        "content": "  « Je ne me crois pas le droit de tuer un homme; mais je me sens le devoir d’exterminer le mal. J’ai voté la fin du tyran. . . . J’ai voté la fraternité, la concorde, l’aurore! J’ai aidé à la chute des préjugés et des erreurs. Les écroulements des erreurs et des préjugés font de la lumière. Nous avons fait tomber le vieux monde, nous autres, et le vieux monde, vase des misères, en se renversant sur le genre humain, est devenu une urne de joie. »  [“I did not think that I had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil. I voted the end of the tyrant. . . . I voted for fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light. We have caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn of joy.”]  —Victor Hugo, Les Misérables, Tome I : Fantine (1862) Part Two: Les Années terriblesThe second half of La Révolution française covers the first two years of the French First Republic. The narrative starts from the aftermath of the Insurrection of 10 August 1792, and ends at the Coup d’état of 9 Thermidor. 13 August 1792: Imprisonment of the royal family  As crowds rampaged through Paris destroying all symbols and images of royalty down to the very word ‘king’ in street names, the Legislative Assembly declared the monarchy suspended until a national Convention had met to decide on the future form of government. Only the efforts of Vergniaud averted the abolition of monarchy there and then. But as the king was transferred, under close custody, to the keep of the Temple, a medieval fortress in the north-eastern suburbs, few believed that he would ever sit on the throne again unless with foreign aid.  Power now lay not with the Assembly, but with the new Paris commune. The Assembly acted as if it was still in charge: for example it appointed a new team of ministers. The three who had fallen on 13 June were at last restored, tainted though they now were by association with the equivocating Brissotins. But the most sensational appointment was the new minister of justice, Danton, who had built a career entirely in the sectional politics of Paris since 1789, and was brought in explicitly to keep the sansculottes happy. The appointments were made by less than 300 deputies. The majority had simply gone to ground over the previous few weeks, thus further diminishing the Assembly’s authority. During the six weeks left to it, this rump did almost everything the commune wanted.   [WD]Camilles Desmoulins is appointed Secretary-General to Danton. 17 August 1792: Exile of La Fayette  What the commune wanted most was vengeance—on those who had abetted the king, and those who had resisted the popular will before and during the uprising of 10 August, on refractory priests protected for too long by the deposed tyrant, and on Lafayette, the butcher of the Champ de Mars and would-be military dictator. He at least escaped: after toying briefly with marching his army on Paris, on 17 August, the day the council of ministers decided to dismiss him, he crossed the Prussian lines and gave himself up to the enemy. Even that brought him five years in Austrian prisons.   [WD] 26 August 1792: Fall of Longwy  The paranoid atmosphere only grew worse when it was learned that the Prussians had invaded French territory; and news arriving on the twenty-sixth of the fall of Longwy, with scarcely any resistance, seemed to confirm that traitors were everywhere. The response of Danton, who increasingly dominated his fellow ministers during these weeks, was to demand a general search of all dwellings in the capital for hidden arms and suspects. These ‘domiciliary visits’ took place on 30–31 August, resulting in 3,000 further arrests. The result was to cram the prisons of Paris to bursting-point with presumed traitors.   [WD]  M. Danton.  . . . il était important de se saisir des traîtres, mais y en eût-il 30,000 à arrêter, il faut qu’ils soient arrêtés demain, et que demain Paris communique avec la France entière.  [AP, Tuesday 28 August 1792]Meanwhile, Danton rejects the proposal of abadoning Paris.  The executive council, composed of the ministers, was summoned by the committee of general defence, to deliberate on the best measures to be adopted in this perilous conjuncture. Some proposed to wait for the enemy under the walls of the capital, others to retire to Saumur. “You are not ignorant,” said Danton, when his turn to speak arrived, “that France is Paris; if you abandon the capital to the foreigner, you surrender yourselves, and you surrender France. It is in Paris that we must defend ourselves by every possible means. I cannot sanction any plan tending to remove you from it.”  [FAM]A few weeks ago, Horace-Camille Desmoulins—the only child of Camille and Lucile—was born. His godfather is Robespierre.  On July 6th, 1792, at nine o’clock in the morning, Horace-Camille Desmoulins was born, the baby who was never really to know either his father or mother, who it is scarcely probable could even remember them in after years. It is possible that “the little Horace” may have had dim memories of that beautiful young mother, who must have seemed to his baby brain like some pictured angel as she bent over his cradle. Perhaps he vaguely remembered that boyish, excitable father, with brilliant dark eyes, who would romp with his “little lizard” in the evenings, rolling with him on the floor in peals of laughter, while Danton sat by quietly smiling and thinking of his own boys at the old home in Arcis-sur-Aube.  —Violet Methley, Camille Desmoulins: A Biography (1914)In the film, Camille Desmoulins is consistently portrayed as a humanist objecting to terror towards civilians. In reality, as a main promoter of popular violence, his political opinions were more radical and, before the Reign of Terror, somewhat closer to those of Marat. 29 August – 2 September 1792: Battle of Verdun  At this period the Prussians, advancing on the plan of invasion described above, passed the frontier, after a march of twenty days. The army of Sedan was without a leader, and incapable of resisting a force so superior in numbers and so much better organised. On the 20th of August, Longwy was invested by the Prussians; on the 21st it was bombarded, and on the 24th it capitulated. On the 30th the hostile army arrived before Verdun, invested it, and began to bombard it. Verdun taken, the road to the capital was open. The capture of Longwy, and the approach of so great a danger, threw Paris into the utmost agitation and alarm.   [FAM] 2–7 September 1792: September Massacres  After 10 August Marat, the self-styled friend of the people but hitherto too extreme and bloodthirsty in his opinions to command much support, came into his own. His solution to the crisis was massacre, both of the suspects herded together in the prisons and indeed of selected ministers and deputies. Many sections, and their representatives on the commune, thought the same . . .  The trigger was further bad news from the front. After Longwy, Verdun came under Prussian siege, and on 2 September news came that the enemy had passed it. There were no other fortresses on the road to Paris. Danton, in his most famous speech, urged his compatriots to defiance—‘If we are bold, bolder still, and forever bold, then France is saved!’—but the predominant mood in Paris was panic. That afternoon, a convoy of prisoners going from the Hôtel de Ville to the Abbaye prison was stopped and attacked by sansculottes. Seventeen of them were hacked to death. Soon afterwards, a makeshift prison at the old Carmelite convent was attacked and there was more butchery, although most of it was now directed by a kangaroo court. By the end of the afternoon the commune had taken a hand, but only to co-ordinate the massacres, not to stop them. The next day it sent a circular to provincial centres hinting that they might like to follow the Parisian example. By then all except two of the capital’s prisons had been broken into, makeshift tribunals established claiming to dispense the people’s justice, and vengeance visited on all those deemed from the charges against them to be potential counter-revolutionaries. Extravagant celebrations and cheering marked each acquittal, and there were plenty of them. Even so, about half the prison population of Paris, between 1,100 and 1,400 people, were killed between 2 September and the last incidents on the seventh; and most of the victims were in no sense politically dangerous. Certainly, they included surviving Swiss defenders of the Tuileries, over 200 priests, and a number of prominent relics of the old order such as the former foreign minister Montmorin, or the queen’s notorious favourite the Princess de Lamballe. Forty-five political prisoners were also massacred at Versailles on the ninth, including Delessart. But most of those who died were common criminals, forging assignats being the nearest any of them came to subversive activity.    [WD]These massacres are at least excused, if not encouraged, by executive leaders including Danton.  The real truth would seem to be that Danton tacitly permitted the massacres, although he did not himself organise them. Possibly he felt himself to be powerless in the matter, and feared to lose his influence with the people if he interfered with their frightful vengeance. The country was in the most terrible and imminent danger; he may have beheved, with the mob, that there was real peril from the plots of the imprisoned aristocrats. All the thoughts and actions of the Minister of Justice at this moment were directed towards the defeat of the enemy who was advancing towards Paris. . . .  What we have said of Danton applies to Camille in a minor degree. . . . We have no means of ascertaining what his private opinion concerning them may have been, but it must be confessed that his pamphlet on the events of June 20th . . . indirectly advocated such a method of popular vengeance as that which was so terribly carried out on September 2nd and 3rd.  It is almost certain that Danton and Camille alike later felt themselves to have been morally responsible for the massacres. The epithet of “Septembriseur” had the power to make Danton falter to the day of his death; he could not hear it applied to him, with a conscience clear of guilt.  —Violet Methley, Camille Desmoulins: A Biography (1914) 20 September 1792: Battle of Valmy  On 20 September, at Valmy, just east of Châlons, the French forces at last made a stand. Kellermann and Dumouriez had more men that the Prussians. They had fewer guns, but those they had were superior, and handled by graduates of the outstand- ing pre-revolutionary gunnery schools. So they outgunned the enemy, and when they followed up their advantage the French charged to cries of Vive la Nation! and the singing of ‘Ça ira’. They fought with an enthusiasm and determination not seen on European battlefields for generations, and they stopped the invaders in their tracks. Watching all this was Goethe, brought along by the Duke of Weimar to enliven the expected military promenade. In the stunned disappointment of the Prussian camp that damp night he offered Job’s comfort to his fellow invaders. ‘Here and today,’ he told them, ‘a new epoch in the history of the world has begun, and you can boast you were present at its birth.’    [WD]This is a decisive victory of the French army commanded by general François Christophe Kellermann (Bernard Celeyron) against the Prussians commanded by the Duke of Brunswick.  The Prussian army had followed the movements of Dumouriez. On the 20th, it attacked Kellermann at Valmy, in order to cut off from the French army the retreat on Chalons. There was a brisk cannonade on both sides. The Prussians advanced in columns towards the heights of Valmy, to carry them. Kellermann also formed his infantry in columns, enjoined them not to  re, but to await the approach of the enemy, and charge them with the bayonet. He gave this command, with the cry of Vive la nation! and this cry, repeated from one end of the line to the other, startled the Prussians still more than the  rm attitude of our troops. The duke of Brunswick made his somewhat shaken battalions fall back; the  ring continued till the evening; the enemy attempted a fresh attack, but were repulsed. The day was ours; and the success of Valmy, almost insigni cant in itself, produced on our troops, and upon opinion in France, the effect of the most complete victory.   [FAM] 21 September 1792: Abolition of the monarchyThe day after the Battle of Valmy, the new National Convention, presided over by Pétion, makes the Proclamation de l’abolition de la royauté, which is proposed by Jean-Marie Collot d’Herbois (Steve Kalfa), deputy of Paris.  Collot-d’Herbois.  Vous venez de prendre une délibération sage ; mais il en est une grande, une salutaire, une indispensable ; il en est une que vous ne pouvez remettre à demain, que vous ne pouvez remettre à ce soir, que vous ne pouvez différer un seul instant, sans être infidèles au vœu de la nation; c’est Vabolition de la royauté. (Applaudissements unanimes.)  Je demande que la Convention nationale déclare que la base immuable de toutes ses opérations sera l’abolissement de la royauté. (Nouveaux applaudissements.)  [AP, Friday 21 September 1792]In the film, the procedures of several successive days at the National Convention are combined into one single session. The Convention first met on 20 September. The next day, monarchy was officially abolished. The news about the victory at Valmy was not heard in Paris until 22, when Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne (Serge Dupire) proposed to date 1792 as the First Year of the French Republic.  Billaud-Varenne demande qu’à compter de la journée d’hier, au lieu de dater les actes l’an quatrième de la liberté, etc… on date l’an premier de la République française. (Vifs applaudissements des tribunes.)  [AP, Saturday 22 September 1792]Three days later, the Convention prounced that “the French Republic is one and indivisible,” initiated by Danton:  Danton.   . . . après avoir posé ces bases qui garantissent le règne de l’égalité, anéantissons cet esprit de parti qui nous perdrait. On prétend qu’il est parmi nous des hommes qui ont l’opinion de vouloir morceler la France ; faisons disparaître ces idées absurdes, en prononçant la peine de mort contre leurs auteurs. La France doit être un tout indivisible; elle doit avoir unité de représentation. Les citoyens de Marseille veulent donner la main aux citoyens de Dunkerque. Je demande donc la peine de mort contre quiconque voudrait détruire l’unité en France, et je propose de décréter que la Convention nationale pose pour base du gouvernement qu’elle va établir l’unité de représentation et d’exécution. (Applaudissements.)  (La Convention nationale décrète, à l’unanimité, que la République française est une et indivisible.)  [AP, Tuesday 25 September 1792] 13 November 1792: Debut of Saint-JustThe first time on the lectern, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just (Christopher Thompson) delivered the electrifying speech—“The King must reign or die.”  Saint-Just.   . . . Outre ces motifs, qui tous vous portent à ne juger pas Louis comme citoyen mais à le juger cOraihë rébelié, de âiiel droit réclâmerait-il pour être jugé civilement l’engagement que nous avions pris àvép lui, lorsqu il est Clair qu il a violé lé seul quMl avait pris ênvers nous, celui de nous conserver? Quel serait cet acte dernier de la tyrannie, que de prétendre être jugé par des lois qu’il a détruites? Et, citoyens, si nous lui accordions de le juger civilement, c’est-à-dire suivant les lois, c’est-à-dire en citoyen, à ce titre il nous jugerait, il jugerait le peuple même.  Pour moi, je ne vois point de milieu : cet homme doit régner ou mourir. Il vous prouvera que tout ce qu’il a fait, il l’a fait pour soutenir lé dépôt qui lui était confié ; car, en engageant avec lui cette discussion, vous ne lui pouvez demander compte de sa malignité cachée : il vohs perdra dans le cercle vicieux que vous tracez vous-mêmes pour l’accuser.  [AP, Tuesday 13 November 1792]The president of the session should be Hérault de Séchelles (appears later) rather than Pétion.The private meeting of Danton and Robespierre as shown in the film before Saint-Just’s address is probably fictional. But Robespierre’s demand for the King’s death was well reflected in his speech on 3 December—“Louis must die because the nation must live.”  Maximilien Robespierre.  Citoyens, l’Assemblée a été entraînée, à son insu, loin de la véritable question. Il n’y a point ici de procès à faire. Louis n’est un point accusé. Vous n’êtes point des juges. Vous n’êtes, vous ne pouvez être que des hommes d’Etat, et les représentants de la nation. Vous n’avez point une sentence à rendre pour ou contre un homme, mais une mesure de salut public à prendre, un acte de providence nationale à exercer. (Applaudissements.)  . . . Mais Louis doit mourir, parce qu’il faut que la patrie vive. Chez un peuple paisible, libre et respecté au dedans comme au dehors, on pourrait écouter les conseils qu’on vous donne d’être généreux. Mais un peuple à qui l’on dispute encore sa liberté, après tant de sacrifices et de combats ; un peuple chez qui les lois ne sont encore inexorables que pour les malheureux ; un peuple chez qui les crimes de la tyrannie sont des sujets de dispute, doit désirer qu’on le venge ; et la générosité dont on nous flatte ressemblerait trop à celle d’une société de brigands qui se partagent des dépouilles.  [AP, Monday 3 December 1792]Contrary to the plea of Robespierre, the Natonal Convention decided on the same day to put Louis XVI on trial.  11 December 1792: Interrogation of Louis XVI  Louis had been confined in the Temple for four months. . . . He had only one servant about his person, Clery, who at the same time waited on his family. During the first months of his imprisonment, he was not separated from his family; and he still found solace in meeting them. He comforted and supported his two companions in misfortune, his wife and sister; he acted as preceptor to the young dauphin, and gave him the lessons of an unfortunate man, of a captive king. . . . But the consolation he found in the sight of his family did not last long; as soon as his trial was decided, he was separated from them. . . .  In this state of things, Santerre received the order to conduct Louis XVI. to the bar of the convention. He repaired to the Temple, accompanied by the mayor, who communicated his mission to the king, and inquired if he was willing to descend. Louis hesitated a moment, then said: “This is another violence. I must yield!” and he decided on appearing before the convention; not objecting to it, as Charles I.  [FAM]At this time, the mayor of Paris is Nicolas Chambon (Michel Voletti), in whose carriage Louis is brought to the National Convention, chaired by Bertrand Barère (François-Éric Gendron).  Santerre, commandant de la garde nationale, paraît à la barre.  Citoyen président, dit-il, nous venons d’exécuter le décret de l’Assemblée. Louis Capet est arrivé; il est aux portes de la salle, il attend vos ordres.  Le Président (Barère).  La Convention nationale a ordonné que Louis serait traduit à la barre. Faites exécuter son décret.  Santerre quitte la salle des séances.  (Un silence profond s’établit dans l’Assemblée et parmi les citoyens qui Vl’nvironnent.)  Le Président.  Louis, la nation française vous accuse. L’Assemblée nationale a décrété, le 3 décembre,.que vous seriez jugé par elle; le 6 décembre, elle a décrété que vous seriez traduit à sa barre. On va vous lire i’acte énonciatif des délits qui vous sont imputés. Vous pouvez vous asseoir.  (Louis s’assied.)  Mailhe, secrétaire, fait lecture de cet acte en entier.  [AP, Tuesday 11 December 1792]Secretary Jean-Baptiste Mailhe then reads the indictment, presented to the Convention the day before by Robert Lindet (appears later). Excerpts of the interrogation by Barère is depicted in the film:  Le Président dit ensuite :  Louis, vous allez répondre aux questions que la Convention nationale me charge de vous faire.  Louis, le peuple français vous accuse d’avoir commis une multitude de crimes pour établir votre tyrannie, en détruisant sa liberté.  . . .  Le Président.  Après votre arrestation à Varennes, l’exercice du pouvoir exécutif fut un moment suspendu dans vos mains, et vous conspirâtes encore. Le 17 juillet, le sang des citoyens fut versé au Champ-de-Mars. Une lettre de votre main, écrite en 1790, à La Fayette, prouve qu’il existait une coalition criminelle entre vous et La Fayette, à laquelle Mirabeau avait accédé. . . . Qu’avez-vous à répondre?  Louis.  Ce qui s’est passé le 17 juillet ne peut, en aucune manière, me regarder ; pour le reste, je n’en ai aucune connaissance.  . . .  Le Président.  Vos frères, ennemis de l’Etat, ont rallié les émigrés sous leurs drapeaux; ils ont levé des régiments, fait des emprunts et contracté des alliances en votre nom; vous ne les avez désavoués qu’au moment où vous avez été bien certain que vous ne pouviez plus nuire à leurs projets. . . . Qu’avez-vous à répondre?  Louis.  J’ai désavoué toutes les démarches de mes frères, aussiôt qu’elles sont parvenues à ma connaissance, comme la Constitution me le prescrivait. Je n’en ai aucune de ce billet.  . . .  Le Président.  Le Corps législatif avait rendu, le 29 novembre, un décret contre les prêtres factieux : vous en avez suspendu l’exécution. Qu’avez-vous à répondre?  Louis.  La Constitution me laissait la sanction libre des décrets.  . . .  Le Président.  Pourquoi avez-vous fait doubler la garde des Suisses dans les premiers jours du mois d’août?  Louis.  Toutes les autorités constituées l’ont su ; et parce que le château était menacé d’être attaqué, j’étais une autorité constituée, je devais le défendre.  . . .  Le Président.  Vous avez fait couler le sang des Français. Qu’avez-vous à Répondre?  Louis.  Non, Monsieur ; ce n’est pas moi.  . . .  Dufriche-Valazé.  Voici une lettre de Louis Capet, en date du 29 juin 1790, laquelle établit la coalition entre Bailly et La Fayette, afin d’opérer une contre-révolution.  Le Président.  Reconnaissez-vous votre écriture ?  Louis.  Cela a l’air d’être mon écriture ; mats je me réserve d’expliquer ce qui peut y être contenu.  Dufriche-Valazé.  Voici une pièce ; il y a en tête : M. de La Fayette. Mémoire de….. (on ne peut lire le nom) 29 juin 1792. . . .  Le Président.  Louis, reconnaissez-vous cette lettre?  Louis.  Je demande à l’examiner avec attention ; il parait qu’elle n’a point été envoyée ; c’est un projet.  Le Président.  Huissiers, présentez la lettre.  Louis.  Je ne la connais pas.  . . .  Le Président.  Avant de communiquer la pièce à Louis, j’ai une question à lui faire. Avez-vous fait construire une armoire dans la muraille du château des Tuileries, garnie d’une porte de fer? Y avez-vous renfermé des papiers?  Louis.  Je n’en ai aucune connaissance.  [AP, Tuesday 11 December 1792]At the time of the trial, the division of the National Convention into the Girondins (Brissots, Vergniaud, etc.) and the Montagnards (Danton, Robespierre, Desmoulins, Marat, Legendre, etc.) is clearly shown in their sitting.  During a long examination, he (Louis XVI) displayed much calmness and presence of mind, he replied to each question appropriately, often in an affecting and triumphant manner. He repelled the reproaches addressed to him respecting his conduct before the 14th of July, reminding them that his authority was not then limited; before the journey to Varennes, by the decree of the constituent assembly, which had been satis ed with his replies; and after the 10th of August, by throwing all public acts on ministerial responsibility, and by denying all the secret measures which were personally attributed to him. This denial did not, however, in the eyes of the convention, overthrow facts, proved for the most part by documents written or signed by the hand of Louis XVI. himself; he made use of the natural right of every accused person. Thus he did not admit the existence of the iron chest, and the papers that were brought forward. Louis XVI. invoked a law of safety, which the convention did not admit, and the convention sought to protect itself from anti-revolutionary attempts, which Louis XVI. would not admit.   [FAM] 26 December 1792: Defense of Louis XVILouis XVI attends the Convention again with his defense team—Raymond de Sèze, Chrétien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, and François Denis Tronchet. Louis’s last statement is presented in the film with light modification to the original text:  Louis prend la parole et dit :  Citoyens,  On vient de vous exposer mes moyens de défense : je ne les renouvellerai point. En vous parlant peut-être pour la dernière fois, je vous déclare que ma conscience ne me reproche rien, et que mes défenseurs ne vousontditque la vérité.  Je n’ai jamais craint que ma conduite fût examinée publiquement; mais mon cœur est déchiré de trouver dans l’acte d’accusation, l’imputation d’avoir voulu faire répandre le sang du peuple, et surtout que les malheurs du 10 août me soient attribués.  J’avoue que les preuves multipliées que j’avais données dans tous les temps, de mon amour pour le peuple, et la manière dont je m’étais toujours conduit, me paraissaient devoir prouver que je craignais peu de m’exposer pour épargner son sang, et éloigner à jatnais de moi une pareille imputation.  [AP, Wednesday 26 December 1792] 15–17 January 1793: Verdict and sentence  « La Convention nationale décrète quelle ira demain aux voix, par appel nominal, sur les trois questions suivantes, dans cet ordre et dans la même séance :  1° Louis est-il coupable de conspiration contre la liberté de la nation et d’attentat contre la sûreté générale de l’Etat?  2° Le jugement, quel qu’il soit, sera-t-il envoyé à la sanction du peuple?  3° Quelle peine lui sera-t-il infligée? »  [AP, Wednesday 14 January 1793]The first two questions was voted on 15 January:                   1°      2°              YES      673      286              NO      0      423              Recused or abstained      10      12              Various statements      32                     Did not answer      3               The assembly had unanimously decided that Louis was guilty, when the appeal to the people was put to the question. Two hundred and eighty-four voices voted for, four hundred and twenty-four against it; ten declined voting. Then came the terrible question as to the nature of the punishment. Paris was in a state of the greatest excitement: deputies were threatened at the very door of the assembly; fresh excesses on the part of the populace were dreaded; the Jacobin clubs resounded with extravagant invectives against Louis XVI., and the Right. The Mountain, till then the weakest party in the convention, sought to obtain the majority by terror, determined, if it did not succeed, none the less to sacri ce Louis XVI. Finally, after four hours of nominal appeal, the president, Vergniaud, said: “Citizens, I am about to proclaim the result of the scrutiny. When justice has spoken, humanity should have its turn.” There were seven hundred and twenty-one voters. The actual majority was three hundred and sixty-one. The death of the king was decided by a majority of twenty-six votes. Opinions were very various: Girondists voted for his death, with a reservation, it is true; most of the members of the Right voted for imprisonment or exile; a few of the Mountain voted with the Girondists. As soon as the result was known, the president said, in a tone of grief: “In the name of the convention, I declare the punishment, to which it condemns Louis Capet, to be death.”    [FAM]Among the 726 deputies being present: 387 voted for “death,” including 26 for the amendament proposed by Mailhe; 44 for “death with respite”; 290 for other penalties; 5 recused or abstained.The session on 16–17 January, where deputies including Lazare Carnot (Jean-Marie Lemaire) and Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet (Daniel Lombart) vote for sentences is reenacted in the film.  Mailhe.  Par une conséquence naturelle de l’opinion que j’ai déjà émise sur la première question, je vote pour la mort de Louis. Je ferai jine seule observation. Si la mort a la majorité, je pense qu’il serait digne de la Convention nationale d’examiner s’il ne serait pas politique et utile de presser ou de relarder le moment de l’exécution. Cette proposition est indépendante de mon vote. Je reviens à la première question et je vote pour la mort.  . . .  Vergniaud.  . . . Il s’agit maintenant de statuer sur la peine à infliger à Louis. J’ai déclaré hier que je le reconnaissais coupable de conspiration contre la liberté et la sûreté nationale. Il ne m’est pas permis aujourd’hui d’hésiter sur la peine. La loi parle : c’est la mort ; mais en prononçant ce mot terrible, inquiet sur le sort de ma patrie, sur les dangers qui menacent même la liberté, sur tout le sang qui peut être versé, j’exprime le même vœu que Mailhe, et je demande qu’il soit sou mis à une délibération de l’Assemblée.  . . .  Maximilien Robespierre.   . . . Je suis inflexible pour les oppresseurs, parce que je suis compatissant pour les opprimés ; je ne Connais point l’humanité qui égorge les peuples, etqui pardonne aux despotes. . . . Je vote pour la mort.  Danton.  Je ne suis point de cette foule d’hommes d’Etat qui ignorent qu’on ne compose point avec les tyrans, qui ignorent qu’on ne frappe les rais qu’à la tête, qui ignorent qu’on ne doit rien attendre de ceux de l’Europe que par la force de nos armes. Je vote pour la mort du tyran.  Collot-d’Herbois.  Eloigné de la Convention nationale, j’ai déjà émis le vœu dont j’étais fortement convaincu ; ce vœu, c’est la mort. Fidèle à ma conscience, fidèle au vœu de mes commettants, je le répète aujourd’hui. . . . Je vote pour la mort.  . . .  Billaud-Varenne.  La mort dans les vingt-quatre heures.  Camille Desmoulins.  Manuel dans son opinion du mois de novembre a dit : Un roi mort, ce n’est pas un homme de moins. Je vote pour la mort, trop tard peut-être pour l’honneur de la Convention.  Marat.  Dans l’intime conviction où je suis que Louis est le principal auteur des forfaits qui ont fait couler tant de sang le 10 août, et de tous les massacres qui ont souillé la France depuis la Révolution, je vote pour la mort du tyran dans les vingt-quatre heures.  . . .  Carnot.  Dans mon opinion, la justice veut que Louis meure, et la politique le veut également. Jamais, je l’avoue, devoir ne pesa davantage sur mon cœur, que celui qui m’est imposé; mais je pense que pour prouver votre attachement aux lois de l’égalité, pour prouver que les ambitieux ne vous effraient point, vous devez frapper de mort le tyran. Je vote pour la mort.  . . .  Saint-Just.  Puisque Louis XVI fut l’ennemi du peuple, de sa liberté et de son bonheur, je conclus à la mort.  . . .

Je vote pour là mort, en suspendant son exécution jusqu’après la ratification de la Constitution par le peuple.  [AP, Wednesday 16 and Thursday 17 January 1793] 21 January 1793: Execution of Louis XVIAccompanied by his confessor Henri Edgeworth de Firmont (Richard De Burnchurch), Louis XVI is escorted to the guillotine at the Place de la Révolution (Place de la Concorde). The day was recorded in the memoir of his executioner Charles-Henri Sanson (Christopher Lee):  It was on December 11, 1792, that the monarch appeared before the Convention, then presided over by Barrère, whose cold and trenchant eloquence was to exercise a decisive influence on the final vote. Sentence was passed on January 17. The surprise caused by the result was so great that the votes were counted a second time ; but on the following day it was ascertained beyond doubt that the sentence passed upon Louis Capet was death.  My grandfather heard the news on the 19th. . . . In the evening Charles Henri and his son went out. They learned that the King had asked for a delay of three day to prepare himself for death, and that the petition had been refused ; and Charles Henri, having gone as far as the legislative palace, was positively assured that the only favour granted to the King of France was a final meeting with his family and the assistance of a priest of his religion. It was therefore certain that the execution had been appointed for the following day.  . . .  On the following day, at dawn, my grandfather and my father were roused by the sound of the drums which were calling out the section, each district having to furnish a battalion for the execution. . . . At this stage, I cannot do better than let my grandfather speak for himself and give his own version of the events which followed:  . . .  ‘  The carriage stopped at the foot of the scaffold. The King was sitting on the back seat on the right; next to him was his confessor, and on the front seat two gendarmes. The latter came down first; then the priest stepped out, and he was directly followed by the King, who appeared even more collected and calm than when I saw him at Versailles and in the Tuileries.  ‘  As he approached the steps of the scaffold I cast a last glance around. The people were silent, the drums were sounding, and not the slightest sign of a rescue being at hand was given. Charlemagne was as troubled as I was ; as to my brother Martin, he was younger and had more firmness. He advanced respectfully, took off his hat, and told the King that he must take his coat off.  ‘  “There is no necessity,” answered he; “despatch me as I am now.”  ‘  My brother insisted, and added that it was indis- pensably necessary to bind his hands.  . . .  ‘  In my turn I interfered, and bending to the ear of the priest, “Monsieur l’Abbé,” I said, “ask the King to submit. While I tie his hands we can gain time, and perhaps some assistance may be forthcoming.”  ‘  The abbé looked sadly and eagerly in my face, and then addressing the King: “ Sire,” said he, “submit to this last sacrifice, which shall make you look more like our Saviour.”  ‘  The King held out his hands, while his confessor was presenting a crucifix to his lips. Two assistants tied the hands which had wielded a sceptre. He then ascended the steps of the scaffold, supported by the worthy priest. “Are these drums going to sound for ever?” he said to Charlemagne. On reaching the platform, he advanced to the side where the crowd was the thickest, and made such an imperative sign that the drummers stopped for a moment.  ‘ “Frenchmen!” he exclaimed, in a strong voice, “you see your King ready to die for you. May my blood cement your happiness! I die innocent of what I am charged with!”  [Peuple, je meurs innocent ! Messieurs, je suis innocent de tout ce dont on m’inculpe. Je souhaite que mon sang puisse cimenter le bonheur des Français.]  ‘  He was about to continue when Santerre, who was at the head of his staff, ordered the drummers to beat, and nothing more could be heard.  ‘  In a moment he was bound to the weigh-plank, and a few seconds afterwards, while under my touch the knife was sliding down, he could still hear the voice of the priest pronouncing these words :  ‘ “Son of Saint-Louis, ascend to Heaven!”  —Memoirs of the Sansons, Vol. 1 (1876) 10 February 1793: Death of Gabrielle DantonAntoinette Gabrielle Danton died in childbirth, while her husband was in Belgium and didn’t return to Paris until one week later. She was survived by their sons Antoine Danton and François-Georges Danton.A few month later, Danton takes the hand of the young Louise Gély, or Louise Sébastienne Danton (Muriel Brenner).  Gabrielle Danton’s death had cast her husband into a black frenzy . . . In February 1793 he was hanging in throes of despair over the exhumed body of his wife: in July the distracted widower married pretty Louis Gély, beneath whose little hand he was to low his haughty head—so low, indeed, as to accept the benediction of a Roman priest.  Loneliness at his own fireside was the thing that tried him most. “I must have women!” he said on August 26, in reference to his second marriage. What he needed was “one woman,” and she a house-wife: I have already spoken of his necessities—a comfortable existence, and love into the bargain.  —Louis Madelin, Danton (1921)The letter mentioned when Danton and Robespierre stroll in the garden of the Château de Champs-sur-Marne was sent on 15 February.  Robespierre à Danton  15 février 1793  Si dans les seuls malheurs qui puissent ébranler une âme telle que la tienne, la certitude d’avoir un ami tendre et dévoué peut t’offrir quelque consolation, je te la présente. Je t’aime plus que jamais et jusqu’à la mort. Dans ce moment je suis toi-même. Ne fermes point ton cœur aux accens de l’amitié qui ressent toute ta peine. Pleurons ensemble nos amis, et fesons bientôt ressentir les effets de notre douleur profonde aux tirans qui sont les auteurs de nos malheurs publics et de nos malheurs privés. Mon ami, je t’avois adressé ce langage de mon cœur dans la Belgique ; j’aurois déjà été te voir, si je n’avois respecté les premiers momens de ta juste affliction. Embrasse ton ami.  [If, in the troubles that can shake a soul like yours, the certainty of having a tender and devoted friend can offer you some consolation, I offer you this. I love you more than ever and until death. In this moment, I am yourself. Do not close your heart to the accents of friendship that feel all your pain. Let us cry over our friends together, and let us soon show the effects of our deep sorrow to the tyrants who are the originators of our public misfortunes and our private misfortunes. My friend, I have sent you this letter from my heart to Belgium; I would have come to see you, if I had not respected the first moments of your just affliction. Embrace your friend.]  Robespierre 10 March 1793: Creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal  Throughout the upheavals of 1792, the value of the assignats had continued to decline. By January 1793 they were down to 51 per cent of their face value, despite the decision to make them legal tender in occupied territories. Coinage, on the other hand, was becoming increasingly rare. . . . By February sugar had doubled or trebled since 1790, and soap had more than doubled. Other items, like coffee and candles, were also rising steadily. These increases provided the impetus behind calls for a maximum, which were renewed in petitions to the Convention and the Jacobin Club between 22 and 24 February. When they remained unanswered, the city was swept by a wave of attacks on grocery shops and warehouses throughout the twenty-fifth. . . . On the twenty-sixth Santerre’s National Guards restored order, but the whole Convention was visibly shaken by the outburst. The Girondins, predictably, blamed the incitements of Marat. . . .  Determined to build on the autumn’s victories and replace the one-year volunteers who were now leaving the army, the Convention decided that the newly expanded war would require more than volunteers. On 24 February it decreed a new levy of 300,000 men to be raised by volunteering, if possible, but conscription if necessary, with each department allotted a quota. . . . Such a return to hated practice only abolished four years previously was bound to be unpopular, and in fact only half the 300,000 men were ever raised. But in some parts it was more than unpopular; and in the department of the Vendée the first attempts to conscript in the early days of March met with violent resistance which within weeks had flared up into an open rebellion against the entire course the Revolution had taken. . . .  Reports of this unprecedented resistance to revolutionary authority began to reach Paris during the second week in March. They coincided with increasingly bad news from Belgium, where the Austrians had counter-attacked on the first and turned the flank of Dumouriez’s advance into Holland. . . . By 8 March it was being alleged in the Convention that the armies were in headlong retreat, and panic swept the capital. Danton, who knew the situation in Belgium at first hand, called for volunteers from Paris to march north and save the campaign, which did nothing to restore calm. . . . Everybody remembered how the previous September the departure of volunteers had occasioned the prison massacres. Certain elements in Paris evidently believed that this was the moment to eliminate the city’s enemies in the Convention. Some sections began to demand the establishment of a revolutionary tribunal to try traitors, and the Jacobin Club took up the call. The Convention accepted the proposal on the ninth and decreed in the same session that deputies should be sent out to all departments, as ‘representatives on mission’, to explain and expedite war emergency measures.  [WD]All these crises and measures are sketched in the dialogue of Danton and Robespierre. The exchange of Brissot and Danton is probably inspired by the Convention speech of the latter:  Danton.   Rien n’est plus difficile que de définir un crime politique. Mais si un homme du peuple, pour un crime particulier, en reçoit à l’instant le châtiment ; s’il est si difficile d’atteindre un crime politique n’est-il pas nécessaire que des lois extraordinaires, prises hors du corps social, épouvantent les rebelles et atteignent les coupables? Ici le salut du peuple exige de grands moyens et des mesures terribles. Je ne vois pas de milieu entre les formes ordinaires et un tribunal révolutionnaire. L’histoire atteste cette vérité ; et puisqu’on a osé, dans cette Assemblée, rappeler ces journées sanglantes sur lesquelles tout bon citoyen a gémi, je dirai, moi, que si un tribunal eût alors existé, le peuple, auquel on a si souvent, si cruellement reproché ces journées, ne les aurait pas ensanglantées; je dirai, et j’aurai l’assentiment de tous ceux qui ont été les témoins de ces événements, que nulle puissance humaine n’était dans le cas d’arrêter le débordement de la vengeance nationale. Profitons des fautes de nos prédécesseurs.  Faisons ce que n’a pas fait l’Assemblée législative ; soyons terribles pour dispenser le peuple de l’être ; organisons un tribunal, non pas bien, cela est impossible ; mais le moins mal qu’il se poura, afin que le glaive de la loi pèse sur la tête de tous ses ennemis.  [AP, Sunday 10 March 1793] 12–24 April: Arrest and acquittal of Marat  The Montagnards had hoped, in setting up the Revolutionary Tribunal, to use it against those whom they saw as impeding the war effort by their vendetta against Paris. Girondins, however, saw that this sword was double-edged, and it was from them that a proposal came on 1 April to abolish deputies’ immunity from arrest. Success in this cleared the way for an attack on the most exposed figure in the Montagnard ranks, recognized even by his own side in their cooler moments as a liability—Marat. As president of the Jacobins, on 5 April he had signed a circular appealing to the provinces to defend Paris against a ‘sacrilegious cabal’ in the Convention, attempting thus to steal what the Girondins regarded as their own constituency. Alleging an insult to the Convention, they called on 12 April for Marat to be impeached; and, with normal Montagnard support depleted by the absence of many of their normal allies on mission, the motion passed overwhelmingly. Thirty-three sections of Paris responded to this attack on their hero by calling for the expulsion from the Convention of 22 named deputies including Brissot, all the Bordelais, and Pétion, who had drifted away from his earlier radicalism since the fall of the monarchy. Both the Jacobins and the commune endorsed the demand, but withdrew their approval when Robespierre, reluctant to see the nation’s representatives coerced, condemned it. In any case they had their revenge on 24 April, when Marat was acquitted by the Revolutionary Tribunal and carried shoulder-high from the court back to the Convention by exultant sansculottes.  [WD] 2 June 1793: Fall of the GirondinsThe purge of the Girondin deputies in the National Convention was another major turbulent event during the Revolution. A series of political dissents between the Girondins and the Montagnards since the beginning of 1793 eventually triggered the Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June.  By May 1793, therefore, the new crisis for the Republic that had erupted in March had grown spectacularly worse. As the armies fell back along every frontier, a new, internal war zone established itself in what would soon be called the ‘military Vendée’; and the Convention even began to lose control of major provincial cities. The response of politicians in Paris was destined to make these problems even worse before they got better.  Immediately after the voting of the maximum there were unexpected signs of support for the Girondins in Paris. . . . With ever more Montagnards or deputies who normally voted their way now absent on mission, the Moun- tain’s usual ability to defeat Girondin eloquence with solid votes seemed threatened. These were the circumstances which finally swung them round to the idea of purging the Convention.  . . . A list of the most obvious candidates for purging had been endorsed by 33 sections on 15 April. It was not, however, until a month later that positive plans began to be laid.   [WD]This is the list of twenty-two arrested in the National Convention session on 2 June presided over by Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles (Jean-Philippe Chatrier), among whom are Brissot, Pétion, Vergniaud, Charles Jean Marie Barbaroux, etc.  « La Convention nationale décrète que les députés, ses membres, dont les noms suivent, seront mis en état d’arrestation chez eux, et qu’ils y seront, sous la sauvegarde du peuple français et de la Convention nationale, ainsi que de la loyauté des citoyens de Paris :  Gensonné, Guadet, Brissot, Gorsas, Pétion, Vergniaud, Salle, Barbaroux, Chambon, Buzot, Birotteau, Lidon, Rabaut-Saint-Etienne, Lasource, Lanjuinais, Grangeneuve, Lehardy, Lesage (d’Eure-et-Loir) ; Louvet (du Loiret) ; Valazé, Clavière, ministre des contributions publiques et Lebrun, ministre des affaires étrangères. »  [AP, Sunday 2 June 1793]  It began in the small hours of 31 May when Varlet, in the name of the insurrectionary committee sitting at the archbishop’s palace, ordered the ringing of the tocsin. Soon after dawn the insurrectionaries formally deposed the commune and reinstated it under their own orders, The gates were closed, a round-up of suspects ordered, and Hanriot, a former clerk who had been made commander of the National Guard (in the absence of Santerre) the night before, was confirmed in office. . . . Varlet wanted to dissolve the whole Convention. Others sought the arrest of the 22 deputies named on 15 April. Still others, including the commune’s procurator Chaumette, urged caution; and seemed simply to want to force the abandonment of the Commission of Twelve, and to scare the Girondins into more moderate conduct. . . . By the time Robespierre moved the impeachment of those named in the petition, the crowds were melting away, and the crisis seemed to have passed.  . . . There was no time to waste, the Montagnards concluded, if civil war was to be avoided: those seeking to foment it must be removed from the national representation. It was therefore agreed to renew the pressure on the Convention on the second, a Sunday, when the sansculottes would not be at work. That morning a deputation from the commune presented a new petition for the arrest of 30 deputies. . . .This time the petitioners were taking no chances. The previous evening Hanriot had posted his men in key positions all around the Convention. Estimates of the number of National Guardsmen on duty vary between 75,000 and 100,000, and they were reinforced by thousands more onlookers. No deputy stood a chance of leaving the chamber, and when one group tried, they were turned back by Hanriot and Guardsmen with drawn sabres. Barère, in the name of the Committee, refused to recommend the arrest of the named deputies; but by now it was clear that the surrounding forces would not go until the Convention surrendered. They no longer had any choice. Before the day ended, therefore, they had decreed the arrest of 29 deputies—all but two of the 15 April list, and most of the Commission of Twelve.  [WD]The insurgents are led by François Hanriot (Jean-Pierre Laurent), Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette (mentioned), and Hébert. Georges Couthon (Bruce Myers, VF: Marc de Georgi), elected to the Committee of Public Safety on 30 May, first proposed the arrest of the “traitors.”  Couthon.  Citoyens, tous les membres de la Convention doivent être maintenant rassurés sur leur liberté. Vous avez marché vers le peuplé ; partout vous l’avez trouvé bon, généreux et incapable d’attenter à la sûreté de ses mandataires, mais indigné contre les conspirateurs qui veulent l’asservir. Maintenant donc que vous reconnaissez que vous êtes libres dans vos délibérations, je demande, non pas quant à présent, un décret d’accusation contre les 22 membres dénoncés, mais, attendu que l’opinion est fortement prononcée contre eux, je propose qu’ils soient mis en état d’arrestation chez eux, ainsi que les membres de la commission des Douze et les ministres Clavière et Lebrun.  [AP, Sunday 2 June 1793]The confrontation of Brissot and Danton in the office of the latter is probably a fictional creation. However, the battle between Brissot and Camille Demoulins was well reflected in several pamphlets. In the film, the one referred to in the exchange of Danton and Robespierre is L’Histoire des Brissotins, ou Fragment de l’histoire secrète de la Révolution, published by Camille in May 1793, which produced a notable destructive power against the Girondins preceding their eventual fall.  It is undoubted that this pamphlet of Camille’s was written at the direct inspiration of Robespierre. During the greater part of this year of 1793 all the work of the journalist was practically dictated by his friend and colleague, who made use of the medium of Camille’s brilliant style to express his own subtle policy.  —Violet Methley, Camille Desmoulins: A Biography (1914) 3 July 1793: Louis XVII separated from his family  On July 3rd, after the prisoners’ supper, that is at ten o’clock at night, the municipal representatives on duty at the Temple, Eudes, a stone-cutter, Gagnant, a painter, Veron, a perfumer, Cellier, a semi-official counsel, Deveze, a carpenter, and a certain Arnaud exercising the singular profession of “reader-secretary,” appeared before the Queen and read to her the decree of the Committee of Public Safety. . . . “After various earnest entreaties, the widow Capet at last determined to deliver her son, who was then led into the appointed apartment and placed in the hands of Citizen Simon who is in charge of it. We would observe moreover that the separation took place with all the sensibility which one would expect under the circumstances, in which the magistrates of the people showed every deference compatible wath the severity of their duty.”  —G. Lenôtre, The Dauphin (Louis XVII): The Riddle of the Temple (1921) 13 July 1793: Assassination of Marat  . . . the Girondists who ought to have remained quiet or fought all together, did not do so, and, after the 2nd of June, all the moderate men of the party remained under the decree of arrest: the others escaped. Vergniaud, Gensonne, Ducos, Fonfrede, etc., were among the first; Petion, Barbaroux, Guadet, Louvet, Buzot, and Lanjuinais, among the latter.  They repaired to Evreux, in the department de l’Eure, where Buzot had much influence, and thence to Caen, in Calvados. These made this town the centre of the insurrection.  [FAM]In the film, the exiled Pétion orates to a crowd in Caen, among whom stands Charlotte Corday (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu).  From there, a young, beautiful, and courageous woman, Charlotte Corday, went to punish Marat, the principal author of the 31st of May, and the 2nd of June. She hoped to save the republic by sacrificing herself to its cause. But tyranny did not rest with one man; it belonged to a party, and to the violent situation of the republic. Charlotte Corday, after executing her generous but vain design, died with unchanging calmness, modest courage, and the satisfaction of having done well. But Marat, after his assassination, became a greater object of enthusiasm with the people than he had been while living. He was invoked on all the public squares; his bust was placed in all the popular societies, and the convention was obliged to grant him the honours of the Pantheon.  [FAM]In Marat’s room, we also see Catherine Évrard (Isabelle Lafon), Simone Évrard’s sister, and Catherine’s husband Jean Antoine Corne, typographer of L’Ami du peuple.Robespierre delivers his funeral speech in before the Jacobins on 14 July, the day after the assassination:  Ce n’est point aujourd’hui qu’il faut donner au peuple le spectacle d’une pompe funèbre, mais quand enfin victorieux, la République affermie nous permettra de nous occuper de ses défenseurs, toute la France alors les demandera, et vous accorderez sans doute à Marat les honneurs que sa vertu mérite, que sa mémoire exige.  —Œuvres de Maximilien Robespierre, Tome IXNevertheless, the Law of the General Maximum was not instituted until 29 September, and was irrelevant to the funeral speech.

Malheureusement on s’en moquera toujours dans les Cours. La puissance qui vient de l’amour des peuples est sans doute la plus grande ; mais elle est précaire &amp; conditionnelle, jamais les Princes ne s’en contenteront. Les meilleurs Rois veulent pouvoir être méchans s’il leur plait, sans cesser d’être les maitres.  [Kings desire to be absolute, and men are always crying out to them from afar that the best means of being so is to get themselves loved by their people. . . . Unfortunately, it will always be derided at court. The power which most of a people’s love is no doubt the greatest; but it is precarious and conditional, and princes will never rest content with it. The best kings desire to be in a position to be wicked, if they please, without forfeiting their mastery.]  —Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique, Livre III (1762) October 1789 – April 1792: Invention of the GuillotineThe short dialogue between Louis XVI and Dr. Joseph Ignace Guillotin (Jacques Ciron) is also advanced for more than half a year. Paradoxically, the guillotine—the notorious decapitation machine and icon of terror—is a product of the humanistic motive of Guillotin back in October 1789.  Guillotin’s special object was to obtain the adoption of another innovation. Disgusted as he was at the sight of the gibbet, which exhibited a corpse for hours before the mob, he determined to substitute for all former modes a punishment by which suffering would be mitigated. He saw no better means for the furtherance of his object than decapitation. . . . But then the executioner’s sword had often failed to accomplish its work; the hand was apt to tremble, and machinery only could give a guarantee of unswerving precision. Guillotin’s purpose was, then, to discover the best decapitating machine; and although the search he undertook was novel work for a man who had hitherto endeavoured to save life rather than to devise means of destroying it, he pursued it with untiring zeal. . . .  ‘In every case of capital punishment the mode of execution shall be the same. The criminal shall be decapitated by means of a mechanical contrivance.’  By a fortunate chance, Charles Henri Sanson (appears later) had become acquainted with a German engineer of the name of Schmidt. . . . One evening, after playing an air of Iphigénie en Aulide, Charles Henri spoke to his companion of his perplexity. Schmidt hesitated for a moment, and then traced a few rapid lines on a piece of paper, which he handed to my grandfather. It was the guillotine.  It was thus that the guillotine came into the world, as it were, in the midst of a concert.  Charles Henri Sanson informed Guillotin of the discovery. If the people gave the name of guillotine to the new instrument of execution—although, I need hardly repeat, the doctor was not the real inventor of it—it was simply a act of justice; for it was owing to his efforts that decapitation and the machine used for its infliction were adopted.  He described the new apparatus in the sitting of April 31, 1791. . . . The Assembly at length appointed Dr. Antoine Louis to enquire into the new mode of decapitation.  —Memoirs of the Sansons, from Private Notes and Documents 1688–1847, Vol. 1 (1876)The participation of Louis XVI in the modification of this machine can be found in the memoir of Charles-Henri Sanson, who later guillotined the King as well as Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and Robespierre.  Louis was the King’s physician, and his royal patron heard of the mission he had to discharge. The dexterity of this prince as a locksmith is well known. He wished to assist Louis, and to give his personal attention to a matter in which, he said, he was interested as as sovereign. The King and his physician expressed as desire to examine the plan of the machine proposed by Guillotin. The latter was therefore requested by Dr. Louis to come to the Tuileries . . .  Guillotin showed Louis the plan of the machine drawn by Schmidt, to which my grandfather had added a few explanations. While Louis was examining it with great attention, a door was opened, and a new comer appeared in the closet. Dr. Louis, who was seated, immediately rose. The stranger looked coldly at Dr. Guillotin, who bowed; and abruptly addressing Louis, he said to him:  ‘Well, doctor, what do you think of it?’  ‘It seems to me perfect,’ answered the doctor; ‘and fully justifies what M. Guillotin told me. You can judge for yourself.’ And he handed the plan to the last comer, who looked at it, and then shook his head doubtfully.  ‘The knife has the shape of a crescent. Do you think a knife thus shaped would be suitable for all necks? There are some which it certainly could not cut.’ . . .  ‘This gentleman is quite right,’ answered my grandfather; ‘the knife is not what it should be.’  The King smiled with an air of satisfaction, and taking a pen which lay on the table, he rectified the plan, and substituted an oblique line for the crescent.  ‘I may be mistaken, after all,’ he added; ‘the two shapes should be tried when the experiments are made.’  —Memoirs of the Sansons, Vol. 1 (1876)This meeting allegedly happened on 2 March 1792. Five days later, the design was approved by the Legislative Assembly. The first experiments were carried out on 17 April 1792, whose results favored Louis’s suggestion. 2 July 1790: Mirabeau’s rendezvous with the QueenThe secret meeting of Mirabeau and Marie-Antoinette in the park of the Château de Saint-Cloud is substantiated:  On July 2d, he went to stay, as he often did, with his niece, Madame d’Aragon, at Passy. Very early in the morning of the following day, he took a cabriolet, and with his nephew, young du Saillant, disguised and acting as a postilion, drove through the quiet summer lanes which then led from Passy to Saint-Cloud. At an unfrequented entrance to the park he left the cabriolet and his nephew: a door was mysteriously opened to admit him and closed again.  In a summer-house, in the highest part of the gardens of Saint-Cloud, Mirabeau met the Queen, alone.  . . . One story has it (there are several differing versions) that when she first saw the man who she believed had “led a band of outlaws to assassinate” the royal family at Versailles, she drew back with “a movement of horror.” That passed. . . . But he won her, as he won everybody.  . . . She spoke afterwards of the deep impression he made upon her. He himself alluded to the interview with a profound feeling, and often to her grace, her dignity, and her charm. Before they parted, it is said that he raised her hand to his lips: “Madame, the monarchy is saved!”  What is certain, is that the interview left him with a yet more resolute determination to serve her: that he imbued her with his master idea, of making the National party the King’s party, and that his influence upon her mind can be traced long after his death.  —Stephen G. Tallentyre, The Life of Mirabeau (1912)The confidential letters mentioned in the dialogue refer to Mirabeau’s Notes to the Court, which were conveyed by Auguste d’Arenberg, comte de La Marck. From June 1790 to March 1791, Mirabeau averaged two notes a week to the Court. Many were destroyed after Mirabeau’s death and the insurrection of 10 August 1792. Only fifty of them still exist.  In the afternoon M. Goguenot returned. He had still the seals of France about him, and he brought me a statement of all he had burnt. . . . The most voluminous was that from Mirabeau. It was tied up with a scheme for an escape, which he thought necessary.  —Memoirs of Madame Campan, Vol. 2 (1909) 14 July 1790: Fête de la Fédération  The 14th of July approached: that day was regarded by the nation as the anniversary of its deliverance, and preparations were made to celebrate it with a solemnity calculated to elevate the souls of the citizens, and to strengthen the common bonds of union. A confederation of the whole kingdom was appointed to take place in the Champ de Mars; and there, in the open air, the deputies sent by the eighty-three departments, the national representatives, the Parisian guard, and the monarch, were to take the oath to the constitution. . . . The immense preparations were scarcely completed in time; all Paris had been engaged for several weeks in getting the arrangements ready by the 14th.   [FAM]During the construction scene involving Parisians from all occupations, the choir sings “Ça ira,” whose music is from the contredanse “Le carillon national” composed by Bécourt.  Ah ! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira, Le peuple en ce jour sans cesse répète. Ah ! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira, Malgré les mutins tout réussira !Camille and Lucile Desmoulins get engaged. This is however an anachronism: in reality, M. and Mme Duplessis did not sent their blessing until December 1790.Another few “rearrangements”: Danton was elected as a member of the Provisional Commune of Paris in January 1790, but the No. 46 of Camille Desmoulins’s Révolutions de France et de Brabant was published on 5 October 1790—the first Anniversary of the October Days. Desmoulins’s famous Discours de la Lanterne aux Parisiens—the defense of political violence that earned him the title “procureur-général de la lanterne”—was nonetheless published in September 1789.All of them are asynchronized with the preparation of Fête de la Fédération.  The vast space of the Champ de Mars was inclosed by raised seats of turf, occupied by four hundred thousand spectators. An antique altar was erected in the middle; and around it, on a vast amphitheatre, were the king, his family, the assembly, and the corporation. . . .  A profound silence now reigned in the vast inclosure, and Lafayette, appointed that day to the command in chief of all the national guards of the kingdom, advanced first to take the civic oath. Borne on the arms of grenadiers to the altar of the country, amidst the acclamations of the people, he exclaimed with a loud voice, in his own name, and that of the federates and troops: “We swear eternal fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king; to maintain to the utmost of our power the constitution decreed by the national assembly, and accepted by the king; and to remain united with every Frenchman by the indissoluble ties of fraternity.” Forthwith the firing of cannon, prolonged cries of “Vive la nation!” “Vive le roi!” and sounds of music, mingled in the air. The president of the national assembly took the same oath, and all the deputies repeated it with one voice. Then Louis XVI. rose and said: “I, king of the French, swear to employ all the power delegated to me by the constitutional act of the state, in maintaining the constitution decreed by the national assembly and accepted by me.” The queen, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, rose, lifted up the dauphin in her arms, and showing him to the people, exclaimed: “Behold my son, he unites with me in the same sentiments.” At that moment the banners were lowered, the acclamations of the people were heard, and the subjects believed in the sincerity of the monarch, the monarch in the affection of the subjects, and this happy day closed with a hymn of thanksgiving.   [FAM]The ceremony concludes the events in the first year of the Revolution. 31 August 1790: Nancy Mutiny  The ‘liberty’ achieved in 1789 was thus a two-edged sword in its practical applications.  National Guard units of ‘active’ citizens in every commune chose their leaders. However, while officer positions in the armed forces were opened to non-nobles, the Assembly stalled at applying popular sovereignty to their election. The army and navy were wracked by internal conflict between noble officers and soldiers over control of regimental funds and the role of the army in repressing civilian protests. There were serious rebellions in the fleets at Toulon in December 1789 and Brest in September 1790. A rebellion in the garrison at Nancy in August 1790 was bloodily repressed by the commander Bouillé, cousin of the commander-in-chief of the army, Lafayette. The Assembly endorsed Bouillé’s actions.  [PM]The execution scene described in the film, where François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé (Jean Boissery) sends the signal to the soldiers of the Swiss Régiment de Castella and Régiment de Vigier, happen on 4 September, when 22 mutineers from the Swiss Régiment de Châteauvieux are hanged and their ringleader André Soret (Matthew Jocelyn) broken on the wheel.  10 November 1790: Danton’s oration at the Assembly  The affair at Nancy, which had aroused so many passions, was the thing which finally roused Parisian opinion . . . Paris is for the first time claiming to govern the councils of the kingdom.  . . . Bailly was sent by the town to “present the Commune at the bar of the Assembly and demand the recall” of the Ministers of Justice, War, and the Interior—De Cicé, La Tour du Pin, and St. Priest.  Danton was taken out of the informal body to which he had acted as secretary, and asked to be the orator of the legal Commune. There followed on the 10th of November a very curious scene.  —Hilaire Belloc, Danton: A Study (1899)The oration of Danton at the National Constituent Assembly in the Salle du Manège was documented, including the interruption by the abbé Jean-Sifrein Maury (Michel Galabru):  M. Danton.  Messieurs, l’Assemblée nationale a cru devoir décider qu’il n’y avait pas lieu à délibérer sur la proposition qui lui a été faite de déclarer au roi que ses ministres avaient perdu la confiance de la nation, l’Assemblée nationale, les amis de la liberté, la France entière . . .  M. l’abbé Maury.  Qui est-ce qui a dit cela ?  M. Danton.  La commune de Paris, plus à portée qu’aucune autre commune du royaume, d’apprécier la conduite des ministres . . .  M. l’abbé Maury.  Pourquoi cela ?  M. Danton. . . . En conséquence de la dénonciation faite par la commune de Paris, contre MM. Champion, La Tour-du-Piu et Guignard, elle supplie l’Assemblée nationale :  1° De déclarer au roi que ces mêmes ministres sont indignes de la confiance publique et de le prier de les renvoyer; . . .  [AP, Wednesday 10 November 1790]These impeachments proved succesful: Minister of War Jean-Frédéric de La Tour du Pin Gouvernet was dismissed on 16 November; so was Keeper of the Seals Jérôme Champion de Cicé on 21 November and Minister of Interior Affairs François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest in January 1791. In his address, Danton yet defended for Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin Saint-Hérem (Yvan Varco), Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief Minister, who is essentially the agent of Mirabeau regarding government affairs.  28 December 1790: Marriage of Lucile and Camille DesmouslinsThe couple wed at the Church of Saint-Sulpice, witnessed by Lucile’s parents and Camille’s political friends—Robespierre, Jacques Pierre Brissot (Jean-Pierre Stewart, in black vest), Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve (Daniel Briquet, in olive vest), etc. Robespierre removes Lucile’s garter inscribed with “Unissons nous pour la vie.”  Those were blessed hours for the young couple, and days full of the profund joy, the bliss, at once sober and intoxicating of great happiness. They installed themselves in the same house with Danton, in the Cour du Commerce. Friendly letters, full of compliments and kind wishes, poured in upon them.  —Jules Claretie, Camille Desmoulins and His Wife: Passages from the History of the Dantonists (1876)It is therefore not unreasonable to place the Dantons among the wedding guests.  2 April 1791: Death of MirabeauOn 8 Feburary, Mirabeau met La Fayette for the last time discussing the salvation of the kingdom and her monarchy. No record shows Danton was around his deathbed. Mirabeau’s decease accelerated the fall of the royalists in a more radical revolutionary age.  A few days afterwards he terminated a life worn out by passions and by toil. His death . . . was considered a public calamity; all Paris attended his funeral; there was a general mourning throughout France, and his remains were deposited in the receptacle which had just been consecrated aux grands hommes, in the name of la patrie reconnaissante. No one succeeded him in power and popularity; and for a long time, in dif cult discussions, the eyes of the assembly would turn towards the seat from whence they had been accustomed to hear the commanding eloquence which terminated their debates. Mirabeau, after having assisted the revolution with his daring in seasons of trial, and with his powerful reasoning since its victory, died seasonably. He was revolving vast designs; he wished to strengthen the throne, and consolidate the revolution; two attempts extremely dif cult at such a time. It is to be feared that royalty, if he had made it independent, would have put down the revolution; or, if he had failed, that the revolution would have put down royalty. It is, perhaps, impossible to convert an ancient power into a new order; perhaps a revolution must be prolonged in order to become legitimate, and the throne, as it recovers, acquire the novelty of the other institutions.   [FAM] April 1791: Resistance to the Civil Constitution of the CleryOn 12 July 1790, two days before the Fête de la Fédération, the National Constituent Assembly voted on the Constitution civile du clergé, which subordinated the French Catholic Church to this revolutionary nation.  . . . Most contentious, however, was the issue of how the clergy were to be appointed in future. To the trenchant objections from clerical deputies in the Assembly that the hierarchy of the Church was based on the principle of divine authority and inspired appointment by superiors, deputies such as Treilhard retorted that this had resulted in nepotism. Only the people could choose their priests and bishops. . . .  In the face of the opposition of most clerical deputies, but impelled by increasing impatience with the intransigence of most bishops, the Assembly sought to force the issue by requiring elections to be held on New Year’s Day 1791, with those elected to swear an oath of loyalty to the law, the nation and the king. . . .  Ultimately, only a handful of bishops and perhaps half the parish clergy took this oath. A large number of the latter subsequently retracted when, in April 1791, the pope, also antagonized by the absorption of his lands in and around Avignon into the new nation, condemned the Civil Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man as inimical to a Christian life. He counselled the clergy of France to regard the constitutional clergy as heretics.  [PM]This is the represented dilemma of Louis XVI and the envoy of Pope Pius VI, as well as the cause of the public violence on reactionary priests.  In Paris the Pope was burned in effigy and hostile crowds prevented refractory priests and their congregations from exercising the freedom of worship vouchsafed as one of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. . . .  The French Revolution had many turning-points; but the oath of the clergy was, if not the greatest, unquestionably one of them. It was certainly the Constituent Assembly’s most serious mistake. For the first time the revolutionaries forced fellow citizens to choose; to declare themselves publicly for or against the new order.   [WD]Slightly earlier, we see a short scene in which Marat and his mistress and future wife Simone Évrard (Louise Boisvert) are printing the 16 April 1791 issue of L’Ami du peuple, which incites the popular anguish aginst the church. However, the real issue number on that day is 431 rather than 118; it mentions no anti-clergy topic; and finally, 16 April 1791 is a Saturday, not Sunday. 20–21 June 1791: Flight to Varennes  The arrangements were made by the queen’s devoted admirer, the Swedish adventurer Count Axel von Fersen. Through him Bouillé was contacted: he promised to provide military escorts when the royal fugitives made the dash for Montmédy, close to the Luxembourg frontier. . . . On the night of 20 June they slipped out of the Tuileries, past guards which had been doubled at renewed rumours of just such an attempt. Despite delays, they got clean away.   [WD]On the carriage are the King, the Queen, the Dauphin, Madame Royale, Madame Élisabeth, and marquise de Tourzel.  The royal family travelled all night without their flight being known at Paris. . . . at eight o’clock in the morning it was still undiscovered; but soon afterwards the news got wind, and circulated with rapidity. Lafayette called together his aides-de-camp, and ordered them to depart immediately, in pursuit of the fugitives . . . He took the responsibility of this order on himself, and affected to believe that the royal family had been carried off by the enemies of the public. The respectful presumption was adopted  by the assembly, and all authorities.  —Adolphe Thiers, The History of the French Revolution (1878)However, later the same day, the royal family are recognized by Jean-Baptiste Drouet (Dominique Pinon) and stopped by Jean-Baptiste Sauce (Daniel Langlet), prosecutor of the commune of Varennes.  At the same time, however, all these troop movements had aroused suspicion at towns along the route, National Guards were called out, and at Sainte-Ménehould, on the evening of 21 June, the king was recognized. Drouet, the local postmaster whose claims to have made the identification launched him into a career in radical politics, made a dash to Varennes, the next town on the route. Here the party was stopped, the whole town turned out, and the troops waiting there could do nothing. On the morning of the twenty-second messengers arrived from Paris with orders to bring the would-be escapers back.  [WD]The National Guard officer galloping on the country road to Châlons is Jean-Louis Romeuf (François Levantal), later a general of the First French Empire. Claude-Antoine-Gabriel, duc de Choiseul (Jean Boissery, the rider), who commands the hussars of Régiment de Lauzun escorting the flight, is arrested in Varennes at the same time. The official resolution to this attempted escape was decreed one month later, consistent with La Fayette’s “The King is abducted” statement earlier.  Nevertheless, despite his humiliating capture and return, the Assembly on 15 July decreed that he had in fact been mentally ‘kidnapped’ and that the monarchist provisions of the Constitution of 1791 would stand.    [PM] 17 July 1791: Champ-de-Mars massacre  The flight to Varennes was the Revolution’s second great turning-point. Like the oath of the clergy, it forced everybody to make choices that most would have preferred not to face. . . . The failure of the attempted escape postponed that danger—but demanded choices of a different order. The monarch had renounced the Revolution, and had explained why at great length in the proclamation he left behind. . . . How could such a man remain head of State? The blackest suspicions of the Parisian populace and radical leaders were confirmed. Republicans now came into the open. All over the capital symbols of royalty were attacked and defaced, and on 24 June the Cordeliers Club delivered a petition to the National Assembly to depose the king or consult the Nation on his fate in a referendum. A crowd of 30,000 escorted its presenters. [WD]The scene is changed to the Cordeliers Convent for the third time (after the dawns of the Bastille Day and the October Days). Marat is addressing to the angry crowds of the Club, now formally the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, founded on 27 April 1790.  The decision (the renewed confidence in Louis XVI as the head of the executive power) led to a breach in the ranks of he democrats. A protest demonstration, called for in a petition drafted by the Cordeliers Club on 16 July, was approved by the Jacobin Club; but the same evening, on Robespierre’s initiative, the Jacobins withdrew their support. The Cordeliers, now faced with alternative of cancelling the demonstration or of going ahead on their own, decided on the latter course. The result as the petition of 17 July, drafted by François Robert and couched in more radical terms: while not specifically demanding a Republic, it called on the Assembly ‘de convoquer un nonveau corps constituant pour procéder au remplacement et à l’organisation d’un nouveau pouvoir exécutif’. . . . societies and clubs were invited . . . to march to the Champ de Mars to hold a peaceful demonstration.  —George F. E. Rudé, The Crowd in the French Revolution (1972)However, an incident led to Bailly’s proclaimation of martial law and the subsequent massacre:  Two Invalides, supposed to be spies, were massacred and their heads stuck on pikes. The insurrection became alarming. Lafayette again repaired to the Champ de Mars, at the head of twelve hundred of the national guard. Bailly accompanied him, and had the red banner unfurled. The crowd was then summoned to disperse in the name of the law; it refused to retire, and, contemning authority, shouted, “Down with the red flag!” and assailed the national guard with stones. Lafayette ordered his men to fire, but in the air. The crowd was not intimidated with this, and resumed the attack; compelled by the obstinacy of the insurgents, Lafayette then ordered another discharge, a real and effective one. The terri ed multitude  ed, leaving many dead on the  eld. The disturbances now ceased, order was restored; but blood had  own, and the people never forgave Bailly or Lafayette the cruel necessity to which the crowd had driven them. This was a regular combat, in which the republican party, not as yet sufficiently strong or established, was defeated by the constitutional monarchy party. The attempt of the Champ de Mars was the prelude of the popular movements which led to the 10th of August.  [FAM]In the film, the order to fire is given by Bailly instead of La Fayette, which is perhaps its most crucial discrepancy with the true history. But unarguably, the reputation of these two royalist leaders had never been restored among the populace afterwards.  The violent affray that took place on the Champ de Mars in July 1791 marked an important stage in the struggle for power between consitutional monarchists (Feuillants) and Jacobins, between liberal bourgeoisie and revolutionary democrats. In Paris it led directly to the eclipse of Bailly and Lafayette as the leaders of the city administration; . . . In terms of the social history of Paris the Champ de Mars affair both represented the first bloody clash within the Third Estate—the growing divisions within which have already been noted—and the culmination of several months of social upheaval and of revolutionary agitation at the end of which de democrats organized in the Jacobin and Cordeliers Clubs appear as the undisputed leaders of the Parisian san-culottes.  —George F. E. Rudé, The Crowd in the French Revolution (1972) September 1791: First ConstitutionThe Champ-de-Mars massacre was followed by a series of prosecutions, from 23 July to 4 August, against radical democrats and their journals. Several revolutionists were forced in exile.Danton and Marat take refuge in London, and later return to Paris in August 1791 and Feburary 1792, repectively. Marat’s dermatosis began no latter than 1790. The pain could be only relieved through extended bath. He personally attributed the disease to his figitive life in sewers and cellars, but the true cause remains obscure.Camille Desmoulins’s newspaper is suspended. He flees to Marseilles, and returns in September. Robespierre, however, stays in Paris. He moves into the house of Maurice Duplay (Jean Bouise) at 398 Rue Saint-Honoré near the Tuileries Palace, and has been residing there until his death in 1794.The Constitution of 1791 was voted by the National Constituent Assembly on 3 September and promulgated by Louis on 14 September. Having officially adopted a consitutional monarchy, the Assembly proclaimed a general amnest. Political activities in Paris were revitalized.Robespierre’s mistake that Marat metions refers to the self-denying ordinance he promoted, that all deputies of the former Constituent Assembly were forbidden from joining the new Legislative Assembly convened on 1 October 1791. This, nevertheless, marginalized the framers of the Consitution after its adoptation and assisted the growing of counter-revolutionary groups in late 1791. The devision between the royalists and the revolutionists were further deepened.  December 1791 – January 1792: Debate on warThe scene is changed to the Club des Jacobins for the first time, with Jacques Pierre Brissot, on behalf of the Girondins, delivering a pro-war speech in answer to the gathering of Armée des émigrés after the Declaration of Pillnitz (17 August 1791) by Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Frederick William II, King of Prussia.  The ‘Brissotins’ argued that the Revolution would not be safe until this foreign threat was destroyed. A military strike at Austria and Prussia, which would be brief because of the welcome the commoners in those countries would give their liberated brothers, would expose internal counter-revolutionaries in the cauldron of armed conflict between old and new Europe. . . . By early in 1792, such was the combination of anxiety, exhilaration and fear pervading the Assembly that most deputies convinced themselves that the rulers of Austria and Prussia in particular were engaged in naked aggression towards the Revolution. They were encouraged in their optimism by the urgings of political refugees in Paris who had formed themselves into a force of fifty-four companies of volunteers ready to depart to liberate their homelands.   [PM]“Vivre libre ou mourir”—the motto of the Jacobin Club—is inscribed below the constitution tablet.In reponse to Brissot’s speeches on 29 and 30 December, Robespierre addressed at the Jacobins Club on 2 and 11 January:  La plus extravagante idée qui puisse naître dans la tête d’un politique est de croire qu’il suffise à un peuple d’entrer à main armée chez un peuple étranger, pour lui faire adopter ses lois et sa constitution. Personne n’aime les missionnaires armés; et le premier conseil que donnent la nature et la prudence, c’est de les repousser comme des ennemis.  [The most extravagant idea that can arise in the mind of a politician is the belief that a people need only make an armed incursion into the territory of a foreign people, to make it adopt its laws and its constitution. No one likes armed missionaries; and the first counsel given by nature and prudence is to repel them as enemies.]  —Œuvres de Maximilien Robespierre, Tome VIII 20 April 1792: Declaration of war on Austria  Le Roi.  Vous venez, messieurs, d’entendre le résultat des négociations que j’ai suivies avec la cour de Vienne. Les conclusions du rapport ont été l’avis unanime des membres de mon conseil. Je les ai moi-même adoptées : elles sont conformes au-vœu que m’a manifesté plusieurs fois l’Assemblée Nationale, et aux sentiments que m’ont témoignés un grand nombre de citoyens des différentes parties du royaume. Tous préfèrent la guerre à voir plus longtemps la dignité du peuple français outragée, et la sûreté nationale menacée.  J’avais dû, préalablement, épuiser tous les moyens de maintenir la paix; je viens aujourd’hui, aux termes de la Constitution, proposer à l’Assemblée Nationale la guerre contre le roi de Hongrie et de Bohême.  [AP, Friday 20 April 1792]The session is presided over by Félix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Préameneu. 29 April 1792: Battle of Marquain  On the Frontiers, our Armies, be it treason or not, behave in the worst way. Troops badly commanded, shall we say? Or troops intrinsically bad? Unappointed, undisciplined, mutinous; that, in a thirty-years peace, have never seen fire ? In any case, Lafayette’s and Rochambeau’s little clutch, which they made at Austrian Flanders, has prospered as badly as clutch need do: soldiers starting at their own shadow; suddenly sheirking, ‘On nous trahit,’ and flying off in wild panic, at or before the first shot; managing only to hang some two or three prisoners they had picked up, and massacre their own Commander, poor Theobald Dillon, driven into a granary by them in the Town of Lille.  —Thomas Carlyle, The French Revolution: A History, Vol. 2 (1923)The Austrian troop defeating the French at Marquain, Belgium are commanded by Louis-François de Civalart (Tomasz Bialkowski). 20 June 1792: March of the sans-culottesAt the Cordeliers Club, Marat cries out again for “purging the world of liberty”:  What struck his contemporaries most, and what stands out in all his writings and his speeches, is his eternal call to massacre. On the day of the fall of the Bastille, he asked for give hundred heads. A year later, he demanded five or six hundred more, not for vengeance, but for national security. As time went on, he showed more avidity. In August, 1791, he wanted eight hundred gibbets towards the end of 1791, he insisted upon five thousand, six thousand, twenty thousand, “And,” said he, “let us not hesitate for an instant.” With the new year, his demands grew: he asked for seventy thousand! His bloodthirtiness grew with the misfortunes of the nation.  —Henri Béraud, Twelve portraits of the French Revolution (1928)A demonstration in the spirit of that at the Champ-de-Mars are led by Antoine-Joseph Santerre (Marc de Jonge) and Victor Amédée de La Fage, marquis de Saint-Huruge. In the film, Louis Legendre is portrayed as another leader.  Accordingly, on the morning of 20 June between 10,000 and 20,000 armed demonstrators converged on the Tuileries from the east in menacing silence. The palace guards made no attempt to stop them as they dragged cannon up the grand staircase and made for the king’s apartments. Now they began to shout slogans, proclaiming that they were ‘sans culottes’, ordinary patriots without fine clothes, come to intimidate tyrants. They found the king alone, and for two hours filed past him uttering threats and demanding the ministers’ reinstatement. But now for the first time Louis XVI showed the unexpected courage which dignified the last months of his dismal life and reign. He refused to be intimidated. He proclaimed his loyalty to the constitution. He even borrowed one of the fashionable new caps of liberty and wearing it drank to the health of the nation. In the end Pétion arrived from the Hôtel de Ville and persuaded the demonstrators to go home, empty-handed.   [WD] 11 July 1792: La Patrie en danger  Citoyens, la patrie est en danger !  « Que ceux qui vont obtenir l’honneur de marcher les premiers pour défendre ce qu’ils ont de plus cher, se souviennent toujours qu’ils sont Français et libres ; que leurs concitoyens maintiennent, dans leurs foyers, la sûreté des personnes et des propriétés ; que les magistrats au peuple veillent attentivement ; que tous, dans un courage calme, attribut de la véritable force, attendent, pour agir, le signal de la loi, et la patrie sera sauvée. » (Applaudissements.)  [AP, Wednesday 11 July 1792]In early July, the pressure of the coalition of foreign European powers forced the Assembly to announce that “The country is in danger!”  Jean Debry, in the name of the same commission, proposed that the assembly should secure the tranquillity of the people, now greatly disturbed, by declaring that when the crisis became imminent, the assembly would declare the country is in danger; and that it would then take measures for the public safety. . . . Vergniaud, in a speech which deeply moved the assembly, drew a vivid picture of all the perils to which the country was at that moment exposed. He said that it was in the name of the king that the emigrants were assembled, that the sovereigns of Europe had formed a coalition, that foreign armies were marching on our frontiers, and that internal disturbances were taking place. . .  . . . on the 5th July the assembly pronounced the solemn declaration: Citizens, the country is in danger! All the civil authorities immediately established themselves en surveillance permanente. All citizens able to bear arms, and having already served in the national guard, were placed in active service; every one was obliged to make known what arms and ammunition he possessed; pikes were given to those who were unable to procure guns; battalions of volunteers were enrolled on the public squares, in the midst of which banners were placed, bearing the words—“Citizens, the country is in danger!”   [FAM]In the film, the order of Brunswick Manifesto and La Patrie en danger is reversed. The speech of Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud (Steve Gadler) was even earlier—on 3 July.On the same day as the official declaration, Robespierre delivered his Aux Fédérés address at the Club des Jacobins, calling for the protection of their homeland. On 17 July, he presented the Pétition des Fédérés to the Assembly. The speech described in the film probably refers to his Réflexions sur la manière dont on fait la guerre published around the same time:  C’est dans ces circonstances, que nos généraux abandonnent leurs camps; viennent à Paris intriguer au château des Thuileries; et dicter des lois, au sein de l’assemblée nationale. Ils nous apprennent à-la-fois, que nos ennemis extérieurs se rassemblent; et qu’avant de leur faire la guerre, il faut dompter nos ennemis intérieurs.  —Robespierre, Le Défenseur de la Constitution, No. 8 (1792) 25 July 1792: Brunswick ManifestoAn excerpt of the original text of the manifesto issued from Coblenz by Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (Hans Meyer), commander of the Austrian–Prussian army is read by its drafter Axel von Fersen:  . . . s’il est fait la moindre violence, le moindre outrage à leurs Majestés, le roi, la reine et la famille royale, s’il n’est pas pourvu immédiatement à leur sûreté, à leur conservation et à leur liberté, elles en tireront une vengeance exemplaire et à jamais mémorable, en livrant la ville de Paris à une exécution militaire et à une subversion totale, et les révoltés coupables d’attentats aux supplices qu’ils auront mérités.Meanwhile, the whole France is motivated into the state of People’s War.  On 5 July the Assembly reinforced this trend by elaborating a procedure for declaring the Country in Danger: as soon as this state was proclaimed, all government bodies were placed in permanent session and authorized to raise volunteers from their National Guard units to fight at the front along- side the line army. Less than a week later the decree was invoked. As a result, fédérés continued to pour into Paris long after 14 July on their way to the front. Marseilles’s volunteers did not arrive until 30 July, when they marched into the capital singing Rouget de Lisle’s battle hymn, and thereby gave it the name it has borne ever since.  [WD]This battle hymn is none other than Chant de guerre pour l’armée du Rhin, or La Marseillaise.  Insurrection of 10 August 1792Robespierre, at his residence in Maurice Duplay’s house, exchanges opinions on the ongoing politcal instability with Desmoulins and Danton, who is conspiring an armed insurrection against the royalists. Robespierre expresses his objection to dictatorship and his faith to the constitution, but conceives its implementation through a new “National Convention.” Éléonore Duplay (Fabienne Tricottet)—Maurice’s eldest daughter—quickly appears and serves tea.This meeting is likely to be fictional, but it conveys the views of these revolutionary leaders at this time. Moreover, Duplay’s house was indeed used as a meeting place for planning the insurrection of 10 August.  It was now certain that the demonstration of June 20th would have a more violent sequel. Already at the Jacobins on July 15th Danton’s bitter young secretary, the ex-Oratorian teacher, dramatist, and pamphleteer, Billaud-Varenne, had outlined a programme for the next insurrection. Exile the king, he had said: dismiss the generals; elect a National Convention; transfer the royal veto to the people; appoint a new Civil Service; arrest Luckner and Lafayette; deport all public enemies; exempt the poor from taxation. This programme was repeated almost intact in a strongly worded manifesto drawn up by Robespierre, and declaimed by a federal orator at the bar of the House. . . .  Already (July 15th) a co-ordinating committee had been formed of one federal from each department. Within this body soon appeared a secret committee of five members. Vaugeois of Blois, Debesse of the Drôme, Guillaume of Caen, and Simon of Strasbourg were names as little known in Paris as they are to history; but they were the authors of a movement that shook France. They met at Duplay’s house in the rue Saint-Honoré, where Robespierre had his lodgings, in a room occupied by their fifth member, Antoine, the mayor of Metz, during his visits to Paris.  —J. M. Thompson, The French Revolution (1944)Meanwhile, Danton succeeds in transferring the fédérés from Marseilles into an insurgent troop.  President Danton, in the Cordeliers Section, does anotherthing: invites all Passive Citizens to take place among theActive in Section-business, one peril threatening all. Thus he, though an official person; cloudy Atlas of the whole. Likewise he manages to have that blackbrowed Battalion of Marseillese shifted to new Barracks, in his own region of the remote Southeast.  —Thomas Carlyle, The French Revolution: A History, Vol. 2 (1923)The night before the rebellion is painted with some humanistic color:  The outcome was never really in doubt. But as the tocsin rang through the night of the ninth-tenth of August, many of the men who made their way towards the Hôtel de Ville were apprehensive. After dinner Camille Desmoulins and his wife had gone to Danton’s apartment to try to stiffen their morale but had found Danton’s wife Gabrielle in floods of tears. Lucile, who remembered herself “laughing like a madwoman,” took Danton’s wife for some air in the street and found a great crowd in the apartment when they got back, everyone trying to outdo each other with grandiloquent utterances that seemed appropriate to their overwrought sense of historymaking. But beneath the oracular declarations, agitation and fear put everyone on edge. When Camille set off into the night, carrying a musket and promising his wife to stay with the reassuringly enormous figure of Danton, she too began to weep passionately.  —Simon Schama, Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution (1989)These weeping scenes were recorded in the diary of Luile Desmoulins.  After all, these pages from the young wife’s diary, showing a great episode of history from the point of view of the women who waited to hear the upshot of the fight, is of greater interest than any cut-and-dried description. It is so plain throughout that, for the moment, Lucile Desmouhns, Gabrielle Danton and Madame Robert cared very little what was to be the issue of the day. What mattered it if their cause was won, if it meant the loss of their husbands ?  —Violet Methley, Camille Desmoulins: A Biography (1914)The Hôtel de Ville chaired by Jacques Antoine Joseph Cousin (Sady Rebbot) is invaded first. An “Insurrectionary Commune” is founded by insurgent leaders including Danton, Jacques-René Hébert (Georges Corraface), and Jean-Lambert Tallien.  Control of the Hôtel de Ville was essential for the successof insurrection. Once in control of the municipal authority, the revolutionists could depose Mandat, assume control of the National Guard, and deprive the Tuileries of the greater part of its defenders. By eleven o’clock the commissioners of the sections had begun to gather at the Hôtel de Ville. The council general of the commune then in session was following the progress of events with increasing anxiety. In the absence of Pétion, the mayor, who had gone to the Tuileries, its chairman was Cousin, a professor at the College de France. It endured the taunts and abuse of the public in the galleries. It vainly sent municipal officers to prevent the ringing of the tocsin. But on their return they reported evidence of reluctance and hesitation in the revolutionry movement.  Danton himself, as substitute for the procureur général,is said to have given the signal to the bell-ringers and at aquarter before twelve the mournful notes of the great bell of the Cordeliers with that of Saint-André-des-Arcs fell on theears of the expectant city. . . .  By three o’clock in the morning nineteen sections were represented by their commissioners at the Hôtel de Ville. By seven there were eighty-four commissioners, represent ing twenty-eight sections. They called themselves “the new commune” and installed themselves in a hall adjoining the one in which the council general was still sitting.  —George H. Allen, The French Revolution, Vol. 2 (1923)Antoine Galiot Mandat de Grancey (mentioned), commander-in-chief of the Garde nationale, is murdered by the insurgents at the Hôtel de Ville. At dawn, convinced by Pierre-Louis Rœderer (Jerry Di Giacomo), procureur général of the départment of Paris,  the royal family decide to take refuge in the National Assembly, which is in permant session.  While all this was passing at the Tuileries, the insurgents were advancing in several columns; they had passed the night in assembling, and becoming organized. . . . At this moment Roederer arrived, and increased the alarm of the court by announcing that the danger was extreme; that the insurgents would not be treated with, and that the national guard could not be depended upon. “Sire,” said he, urgently, “your majesty has not five minutes to lose: your only safety is in the national assembly; it is the opinion of the department that you ought to repair thither without delay. There are not sufficient men in the court to defend the chateau; nor are we sure of them.” . . . at the renewed urgency of Roederer, the king after looking at him attentively for a few minutes, turned to the queen, and said, as he rose: “Let us go.” “Monsieur Roederer,” said Madame Elizabeth, addressing the recorder, “you answer for the life of the king?” “Yes, madame, with my own,” he replied. “I will walk immediately before him.”  Louis XVI. left his chamber with his family, ministers, and the members of the department, and announced to the persons assembled for the defence of the chateau that he was going to the national assembly. He placed himself between two ranks of national guards, summoned to escort him, and crossed the apartments and garden of the Tuileries. A deputation of the assembly, apprised of his approach, came to meet him: “Sire,” said the president of this deputation, “the assembly, eager to provide for your safety, offers you and your family an asylum in its bosom.” The procession resumed its march, and had some difficulty in crossing the terrace of the Tuileries, which was crowded with an animated mob, breathing forth threats and insults. The king and his family had great dif culty in reaching the hall of the assembly, where they took the seats reserved for the ministers. “Gentlemen,” said the king, “I come here to avoid a great crime; I think I cannot be safer than with you.” “Sire,” replied Vergniaud, who filled the chair, “you may rely on the firmness of the national assembly. Its members have sworn to die in maintaining the rights of the people, and the constituted authorities.” The king then took his seat next the president. But Chabot reminded him that the assembly could not deliberate in the presence of the king, and Louis XVI. retired with his family and ministers into the reporter’s box behind the president, whence all that took place could be seen and heard.   [FAM]At the Salle du Manège, Vergniaud welcomes the King and assures him of the safety of the royal family.  Le Roi.  Je suis venu ici pour éviter un grand crime, et je me croirai toujours en sûreté avec ma famille, au milieu des représentants de la nation. (Applaudissements.)  J’y passerai la journée. (Applaudissements.)  M. le Président (Vergniaud).  L’Assemblée nationale connaît tous ses devoirs. Elle regarde comme un des plus chers le maintien de toutes les autorités constituées.  Elle demeurera ferme à son poste. Nous saurons tous y mourir. (Applaudissements.)  [AP, Friday 10 August 1792]Back at Tuileries, nine hundred Swiss Guards, commanded by Karl Josef von Bachmann (Jean-Pierre Delamour), defend the empty palace with their lives.  Nevertheless it was the Swiss who opened fire, and that sealed their fate when the commune’s forces gained the upper hand after about an hour. Once the Swiss began to retreat, they were pursued by mobs of bystanders without firearms who hacked them to death with knives, pikes, and hatchets, and tore their uniforms to pieces to make trophies. Altogether 600 of them perished, some in supposed safe custody after the siege was over. Less than half that number fell among the besiegers, 90 of them fédérés, and the rest the same sort of shopkeepers, petty tradesmen, and artisans who had been so prominent in the 1789 journées and on 20 June. It was the bloodiest day of the Revolution so far, but also one of the most decisive. Though the king and his family remained unscathed, his authority fell with his palace. As crowds rampaged through Paris destroying all symbols and images of royalty down to the very word ‘king’ in street names, the Legislative Assembly declared the monarchy suspended until a national Convention had met to decide on the future form of government.  [WD]  Finally, the 23rd of September was appointed for opening the extraordinary assembly, destined to decide the fate of royalty. But royalty had already fallen on the 10th of August, that day marked by the insurrection of the multitude against the middle classes and the constitutional throne, as the 14th of July had seen the insurrection of the middle class against the privileged class and the absolute power of the crown. On the 10th of August began the dictatorial and arbitrary epoch of the revolution. Circumstances becoming more and more difficult to encounter, a vast warfare arose, requiring still greater energy than ever, and that energy irregular, because popular, rendered the domination of the lower class restless, cruel, and oppressive.    [FAM](27 new historical figures; 3 mentioned only)",

[Philosophers and statesmen may learn a valuable lesson of modesty from the history of our Revolution, for there never were events greater, better prepared, longer matured, and yet so little foreseen.]  —Alexis de Tocqueville, L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution (1856) A companion to La Révolution française (1989)Prior to the bicentennial of the enlightening, electrifying, yet turbulent and ferocious Revolution that has reshaped human history forever, an international team of filmmakers, including the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine, screenwriters David Ambrose and Daniel Boulanger, historian Jean Tulard, and directors Robert Enrico and Richard T. Heffron, created a grand cinematic epic reenacting those years of illumination and terror. Personally, I find it among the most informative and pedagogical historical films one can ever imagine.Below is an event-by-event breakdown of the film in the chronological order, with the following conventions:Historical figures are in bold text at their first appearances, with the corresponding (cast members) in parentheses.Past tense is reserved for historical supplements to the plot.Remarks on historical incompleteness or inaccuracies, including fictional adaptations, are highlighted in italics.  General references with [acronyms]:[AP]  Archives parlementaires de 1787 à 1860.[FAM]  François-Auguste Mignet, History of the French Revolution from 1789 to 1814 (Bell &amp; Daldy, London, 1868); translated from Histoire de la Révolution française depuis 1789 jusqu’en 1814 (Firmin Didot père &amp; fils, Paris, 1824).[WD]  William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution, Second Edition (Oxford University Press, 2002).[PM]  Peter McPhee, The French Revolution 1789–1799 (Oxford University Press, 2002).Part One: Les Années lumièreThe first part of this panoramic historical film reenacts the last years of the Ancien Régime—from the convocation of the Estates-General of 1789 to the Insurrection of 10 August 1792.Prior to its grand opening sequence featuring the Grand Canal and the Bassin de Latone in the Gardens of Versailles, the films nonetheless begins with a pre-edit scene back to 1775, when the 17-year-old Maximilien de Robespierre (Steve Carretero) delivers a Latin tribute to the newly crowned Louis XVI on behalf of his classmates at the Collège Louis-le-Grand, among whom stands the 15-year-old Camille Desmoulins (Philip-James Valentini).This anecdote was noted down by the abbé Liévin-Bonaventure Proyart, then Robespierre’s teacher at Louis-le-Grand and later his biographer:  En 1775, Louis XVI, après la cérémonie de son sacre, fit son entrée solennelle dans Paris, accompagné de la reine et de la famille royale. Leurs majestés . . . s’arrêtèrent devant le collége de Louis-le-Grand, où elles furent complimentées par l’Université en corps. . . . et ce fut Robespierre que l’on chargea de le lui offrir au nom de ses condisciples, dans un discours en vers qu’avait composé son professeur. Le roi abaissa un regard de bonté sur ce jeune homme qui, élevé dans sa maison, devait un jour lui porter le premier coup de poignard.   —Proyart, La Vie de Maximilien de Robespierre (1850)Nevertheless, the record of this fateful encounter is generally considered unsubstantiated. Leastwise, it could not happen in 1774 according to the caption, as Louis XVI was crowned in Reims Cathedral on 11 June 1775. Royal family in 1788At the opulent royal ball hosted in the Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) of the Palace of Versailles, Louis XVI (Jean-François Balmer) and Marie-Antoinette d’Autriche (Jane Seymour, VF: Béatrice Delfe) make their first appearances. “Madame Déficit” is accompanied by her dancing partner Axel von Fersen (Jean-Yves Berteloot), her superintendent Marie-Thérèse-Louise de Savoie-Carignan, princesse de Lamballe (Gabrielle Lazure), and her favorite Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac (Claudia Cardinale). Polignac sits closer to the Queen at the casino table in the Salon de la Paix, reflecting Lamballe’s gradual falling out of favor since 1785.Shortly afterwards, three royal childern appear at the Hameau de la Reine in the Petit Trianon of Versailles: Dauphin of France Louis-Joseph (Benji Marcus) riding a pony, his elder sister Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, or Madame Royale (Katherine Flynn), and their younger brother Louis-Charles, the future Louis XVII (Sean Flynn). Katherine and Sean are Seymour’s daughter and son in real life. 21 January 1789: Summoning the Estates-GeneralIn the film, Jacques Necker (Raymond Gérôme), the esteemed Controller-General of Finances and Chief Minister of France, advices Louis XVI to summon the Estates-General in order to levy taxes to address the state deficit. This decision-making process was, however, much more tortuous in history, where the idea of restoring this legislative and consultative assembly after more than 170 years was first deliberated on the Assembly of Notables in 1787.  ‘It seems to me’, declared Lafayette in the bureau where he sat on 21 May, ‘that this is the moment for us to beseech His Majesty to fix, immediately, in order to render account to him of all measures and settle their happy outcome forever, the convocation of a truly national assembly.’ ‘What, Sir,’ burst out the Count d’Artois, the king’s brother, ‘are you calling for the Estates-General?’ ‘Yes, my lord,’ replied the young glory-hunter, ‘and even better than that.’  [WD]The date of the Estates-General was officially announced by the previous finance minister Étienne-Charles de Loménie de Brienne on 8 August 1788, before Necker’s return to office on 24 August. A royal edict—Règlement des États généraux de 1789—was issued on 24 January, followed by the nationwide elections of the delegates from the three estates of realm. March–April 1789: ElectionsOn 4 March 1789, inside a church in Guise, Camille Desmoulins (François Cluzet) plans to run for Estates-General deputy, together with his father Jean-Benoist-Nicolas Desmoulins (Jean-Marie Bernicat). Subsequently, Camille is compiling a Third-Estate cahier de doléances—a list of grievances raised by commoners, mainly against the privileges of the First and Second Estates. Camille unfortunately fails the election. Omitted in the film, Jean-Benoist-Nicolas was nominated, but declined due to health reasons.The disappointed Camille moves back to Paris. Walking down the Rue des Cordeliers (nowadays Rue de l’École-de-Médecine), he meets Antoine Simon (Alain Frérot) the shoemaker, and Louis Legendre (Jean-François Stévenin) the butcher, both politicians-to-be. Seconds later, he greets his future wife Lucile Desmoulins (Marie Bunel) and in-laws Claude-Étienne Laridon-Duplessis (François Lalande) and Anne-Françoise-Marie Bois de Veix (Geneviève Mnich). Apparently, M. Duplessis is not very fond of Camille at this moment.  . . . although Camille’s love for Lucile Duplessis grew with each meeting, his suit appeared too hopeless to be even hinted at to the girl’s parents. M. Duplessis would simply have laughed at him; Madame Duplessis might have been kinder, but she most certainly would not have consented to think of the young man as her daughter’s lover, desperately poor and desperately unsuccessful as he still was.   —Violet Methley, Camille Desmoulins: A Biography (1914)A few key figures during the coming Revolution are introduced next:In a Parisian bar, the wealthy lawyer Georges Jacques Danton (Klaus Maria Brandauer, VF: Bernard Murat), reluctant to enter politics, chats with the influential Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau (Peter Ustinov, VF: Roger Carel), who, despite his noble status, is going to represent the Third Estate. Jean-Paul Marat (Vittorio Mezzogiorno, VF: Michel Vigné), physician and scientist, has undertaken political writings, whose Offrande à la Patrie was published earlier that year.It is not evident how the trajectories of Mirabeau, Danton, Desmoulins, Simon, Legendre, and Marat intersected in early 1789. Besides delineating the personal histories and dispositions of these characters, these scenes set up the community background of the future Club des Cordeliers.While Mirabeau never conceals his passion for a colorful private life, Danton is known to be loyal to his wife Antoinette Gabrielle Danton (Marianne Basler), who, in the film, is carrying their future son Antoine. However, Gabrielle’s pregnancy as depicted seems not synchronized with Antoine’s birth in June 1790. 5 May 1789: Opening of the Estates-GeneralThis historic convention opens in the magnificent Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles.  The royal session took place the following day in the Salle des Menus Galleries, arranged in the form of an amphitheatre, were filled with spectators. The deputies were summoned and introduced according to the order established in 1614. The clergy were conducted to the right, the nobility to the left, and the commons in front of the throne at the end of the hall.  [FAM]Among the 1139 delegates were 291 clergmen, 270 nobles, and 578 commoners. As depicted in the film, Louis XVI delivers a short opening speech, whose text is modified from the documentation:  Sa Majesté.  . . . Puisse, Messieurs, un heureux accord régner dans cette Assemblée, et cette époque devenir à jamais mémorable pour le bonheur et la prospérité du royaume ! c’est le souhait de mon cœur, c’est le plus ardent de mes vœux, c’est enfin le prix que j’attends de la droiture de mes intentions et de mon amour pour mes peuples. Puisse, Messieurs, un heureux accord régner dans cette Assemblée, et cette époque devenir à jamais mémorable pour le bonheur et la prospérité du royaume ! c’est le souhait de mon cœur, c’est le plus ardent de mes vœux, c’est enfin le prix que j’attends de la droiture de mes intentions et de mon amour pour mes peuples.  [AP, Tuesday 5 May 1789]Nicker addresses to the assembly for three hours regarding the financial situation.More notable figures show up in this reenactment:Sitting on the left-hand side of the Queen is Charles-Philippe, comte d’Artois, the youngest brother of Louis XVI and the future Charles X (André Penvern).In the front row of nobility, we see Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette (Sam Neill, VF: Pierre Arditi). Even the 7-year-old Dauphin knows he is the hero of the American Independence War.Among the clergy is the abbé Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès (Jean Bouchaud), political theorist and the author of Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ? [What Is the Third Estate?]Camille Desmoulins, attending the convention as a spectator, greets his old classmate Maximilien de Robespierre (Andrzej Seweryn), a Third-Estate deputy for Arras.After the session, Desmoulins reunites with Robespierre at the latter’s place. On the table lays a copy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique (first edition printed in 1762). They recollect the words of an old lecturer at Louis-le-Grand, which are resonant with the core questions in the abbé Sieyès’s Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ? (1789):  1º Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ? Tout. 2º Qu’a-t-il été jusqu’à présent dans l’ordre politique ? Rien. 3º Que demande-t-il ? À y devenir quelque chose.  [1. What is the Third Estate? Everything;  2. What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing;  3. What does it desire to be? To become something.] 20 June 1789: Tennis Court OathOn June 4 1789, Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France, dies at age seven of tuberculosis. Meanwhile, the tension between the estates in the convention ramps up.  The immediate issue was that of voting procedures: while the Third Estate deputies refused to vote separately, the nobility was in favour (by 188 votes to 46) as, very narrowly, were the clergy (134 votes to 114). Ultimately, Louis’s acquiescence in the nobility’s demand for voting to be in three separate chambers galvanized the outrage of the bourgeois deputies.  [PM]A series of following events lead to the formation of the Assemblée nationale on 17 June.  By the second week of the month (June) third-estate patience was running out. Against their previous resolutions, they had already begun to organize themselves and establish procedures, and on 3 June they elected Bailly as their president. There was now constant talk of unilateral action, of declaring the ‘Commons’ to be the national assembly, and of proceeding to verification of powers on that basis without further reference to the other two orders. On 10 June this talk at last culminated in a formal motion, moved by Sieyès, that a final appeal should be sent to the other two orders to join at once in common verification. Failing that, the Commons would proceed anyway. . . . It all played into Sieyès’s hands, and by the seventeenth he felt able to propose the title he had always wanted. By then an overwhelming majority recognized that there was no sensible alternative, and the name National Assembly was adopted by 491 votes to 89.  [WD]Its first president, Jean Sylvain Bailly (Michel Duchaussoy), astronomer and member of the Académie des sciences and the Académie française, presides over the solemn serment du Jeu de Paume on 20 June.  It was feared that the majority of the clergy would recognise the assembly by uniting with it; and to prevent so decided a step, instead of hastening the royal sitting, they closed the Salle des Etats, in order to suspend the assembly till the day of the sitting. . . . At that time Bailly presided over the assembly. . . . At an appointed hour on the following day, he repaired to the Salle des Etats, and finding an armed force in possession, he protested against this act of despotism. In the meantime the deputies arrived, dissatisfaction increased, all seemed disposed to brave the perils of a sitting. . . . one named the Tennis-court; this proposition was well received, and the deputies repaired thither in procession. Bailly was at their head; the people followed them with enthusiasm; even soldiers volunteered to escort them, and there, in a bare hall, the deputies of the commons standing with upraised hands, and hearts full of their sacred mission, swore, with only one exception, not to separate till they had given France a constitution.  [FAM]The Oath can be found in Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel, the official newspaper during the Revolution:  « Nous jurons de ne jamais nous séparer de l’Assemblée nationale, et de nous réunir partout où les circonstances l’exigeraient, jusqu’à ce que la Constitution du royaume fût établie et affermie par des fondements solides. »  [“We swear never to separate from the National Assembly and to meet wherever circumstances require until the kingdom’s Constitution is established and grounded on solid foundations.”] 23 June 1789: Séance royaleThis dramatic royal session is centered around the conflict between the privileged and the reformers, starting from the King’s declarations nullifying the decisions of the National Assembly:  Sa Majesté.  . . . Réfléchissez, Messieurs, qu’aucun de vos projets, aucune de vos dispositions ne peut avoir force de loi sans mon approbation spéciale. Ainsi, je suis le garant naturel de vos droits respectifs ; et tous les ordres de l’Etat peuvent se reposer sur mon équitable impartialité.  Toute défiance de votre part serait une grande injustice. C’est moi, jusqu’à présent, qui fais tout le bonheur de mes peuples ; et il est rare peut-être que l’unique ambition d’un souverain soit d’obtenir de ses sujets qu’ils s’entendent enfin pour accepter ses bienfaits.  Je vous ordonne, Messieurs, de vous séparer tout de suite, et de vous rendre demain matin chacun dans les Chambres affectées à votre ordre, pour y reprendre vos séances. . . .  [AP, Tuesday 23 June 1789]The subsequent confrontation is recorded by multiple sources. As recalled by its main participant,  Le grand-maître des cérémonies s’approcha de moi, et me dit : Monsieur, vous avez entendu l’ordre du roi ? Je lui répondit : . . . Je crois que la nation assemblée ne peut pas recevoir d’ordre. . . . À la vérité, Mirabeau prit la parole et, s’emportant contre le grand-maître des cérémonies, dit à-peu-près ce qu’on a répété depuis : « Allez dire à ceux qui vous envoient que la force desbaïonnettes ne peut rien contre la volonté de la nation : » on a beaucoup loué cette réponse, . . .   —Bailly, Mémoires d'un témoin de la Révolution, Tome 1er (1804)A better-known version of Mirabeau’s defiance of the Grand Master of Ceremonies—Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé (Sebastian Roché)—is found in Adolphe Thiers’s Histoire de la Révolution française, Tome 1er (1823):  « Allez dire à votre maître que nous sommes ici par la puissance du peuple, et qu’on ne nous en arrachera quepar la puissance des baïonnettes. »  [“Go and tell your master that we are here by the power of the people, and that nothing bu the power of bayonets shall drive us away.”]A prominent figurant: Nicolas Sarkozy as the Third-Estate deputy second to the left of Mirabeau. 12–13 July 1789: Riots in Paris  In these circumstances he (Louis XVI) made the final surrender. On 27 June he wrote to the presidents of the clerical and noble orders ordering them to join the National Assembly.  . . . Responsible men now looked forward to a period of dignified calm, allowing a return to normality and social harmony. Yet as July began there was little sign of that. On 26 June four regiments were ordered from the frontiers to the Paris region, and around the same time the king asked the veteran Marshal de Broglie to assume supreme command. On 1 July more troops were ordered up, making a fivefold increase, to well over 20,000, in less than a week. Nobody could fail to notice the build-up, or the number of foreign regiments involved, presumed to be more reliable than French ones. . . . At Court, the queen and Artois remained determined to get rid of Necker. . . . By 11 July they thought they had found them. That afternoon, the minister was presented with a royal letter dismissing him and ordering him to leave the country immediately.   [WD]Counteractions of the royal court include the dismissal of Necker and the military deterrent. Marching in the film are three infantry and one calvary troops. Judging by their uniforms, they are likely to be (in the order of appearance): the Swiss Régiment de Castellas, the French Régiment du Dauphin dragons, the French Régiment de Provence, and the Swiss Régiment de Salis-Samade.  On the following day, Sunday, the 12th of July, about four in the afternoon, Necker’s disgrace and departure became known at Paris. . . . In a short time the city was in the greatest confusion; crowds gathered together on every side; more than ten thousand persons flocked to the Palais Royal all affected by this news, ready for anything, but not knowing what measure to adopt. Camille Desmoulins, a young man, more daring than the rest, one of the usual orators of the crowd, mounted on a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: “Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of a Saint Bartholomew for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the Champ de Mars to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms!” These words were received with violent acclamations. He proposed that cockades should be worn for mutual recognition and protection. “Shall they be green,” he cried, “the colour of hope; or red, the colour of the free order of Cincinnatus?” “Green! green!” shouted the multitude. The speaker descended from the table, and fastened the sprig of a tree in his hat. Every one imitated him. The chestnut-trees of the palace were almost stripped of their leaves . . .  [FAM]This inspiring speech at the Café de Foy near the Galerie de Montpensier in the Palais-Royal is vividly reenacted in the film. So is the attack on the multitude in the Tuileries Garden by the German Régiment Royal-Allemand cavalerie commanded by Charles Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc (Mario Luraschi).In the meantime, Danton launches his political career by orating at the Club des Cordeliers, although its synchronization with the Parisian insurrections is probably fictional. Among the enthusiastic crowd are Marat, Legendre, Simon, and the Saint-Domingue distiller Claude Fournier l’Américain (Georges Trillat). 14 July 1789: Storming of the BastilleThe Bastille, demolished in late 1789, is “reconstructed” using the Château de Tarascon in Bouches-du-Rhône. Most narrative of this siege and sieze is historically accurate.The commanders of defense are Bernard René Jourdan, marquis de Launay (Henri Serre), governor of the Bastille, and Lieutenant Ludwig von Flüe/Louis de Flue (Philippe Chemin), commanding officer of the Swiss Guards from the Régiment de Salis-Samade. On the side of besiegers are Stanislas-Marie Maillard (Patrick Tessari), the “capitaine des volontaires de la Bastille,” who stands on a plank over the moat to get the letter from de Launay, and Pierre-Augustin Hulin (Bernard Lepinaux), who leads one of the two mutinous columns of Gardes Françaises. Jacques-Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière (Michel Melki) serves as the negotiator between the two sides.  On the 13th the insurrection took at Paris a more regular character. . . .  A permanent committee was formed at the Hotel de Ville, to take measures for the general safety.  The next day . . . an alarm was given that the regiments stationed at Saint Denis were on the march, and that the cannon of the Bastille were pointed on the Rue Saint Antoine. The committee immediately sent to ascertain the truth; appointed bands of citizens to defend that side of the town, and sent a deputation to the governor of the Bastille, soliciting him to withdraw his cannon and engage in no act of hostility. . . .  A deputy of the district of Saint Louis de la Culture, named Thuriot de la Rosiere, then requested a parley with De Launay, the governor. When admitted to his presence he summoned him to change the direction of the cannon. The governor replied, that the cannon had always been placed on the towers, and it was not in his power to remove them; yet, at the same time, having heard of the alarm prevalent among the Parisians, he had had them withdrawn a few paces, and taken out of the port-holes. . . .  But the impatient crowd now clamoured for the surrender of the Bastille. From time to time the cry arose, “The Bastille! we will have the Bastille!” At length, two men, more determined than the rest, darting from the crowd, sprang on a guardhouse, and struck at the chains of the drawbridge with heavy hatchets. The soldiers shouted to them to retire, and threatened to  re; but they continued to strike, succeeded in breaking the chains and lowering the bridge, and then rushed over it, followed by the crowd. In this way they advanced to cut the chains of the second bridge. The garrison now dispersed them with a discharge of musketry. . . .  The siege had lasted more than four hours when the French guards arrived with cannon. Their arrival changed the appearance of the combat. The garrison itself begged the governor to yield. The unfortunate De Launay, dreading the fate that awaited him, wished to blow up the fortress, and bury himself under its ruins and those of the faubourg. He went in despair towards the powder magazine, with a lighted match. The garrison stopped him, raised a white standard on the platform, and reversed the guns, in token of peace. . . . The governor, a few Swiss soldiers and Invalides were torn from the protection of those who sought to defend them, and put to death by the implacable crowd.  [FAM]More details can be found in Jacques Léon Godechot’s La prise de la Bastille, 14 juillet 1789 (1965). For instance,  The electors . . . decided to send a delegation to the Bastille. The delegates got there at about teno’clock. De launey received them in friendly fashion at his residence, the ‘Gouvernement’, and as it was lunch time he invited them to share his meal. . . . But the delegation did not go so far; it merely asked the governor to take such measures as might allay the people’s fears. De Launey assured the delegates that he would do no harm to the quartier Saint-Antoine, and gave orders for guns standing on the towers to be withdrawn and for the embrasures to be blocked with planks of wood.De Launay is lynched by the mob on the way to the Hôtel de Ville. Danton and Camille Desmoulins arrive at the Bastille after fortress has already fallen.In the Palace of Versailles, served by his valet Jean-Baptiste Cléry (Geoffrey Bateman), Louis XVI writes down the famous line in his diary:  Mardi . . . . 14  Rien. [Tuesday . . . . 14  Nothing.]At night, Louis is informed of the seriousness of the fall of the Bastille by François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt (Yves-Marie Maurin):  — Mais c’est donc une révolte ? — Non, sire, c’est une révolution !  [– Why, is this a revolt? — No, sire, it’s a Revolution!] 17 July 1789: Reconciliation  Early on 17 July the Count d’Artois left Versailles for the north-east frontier, to be followed over subsequent weeks by many of the courtiers . . . And later the same day the king made his way, escorted only by a handful of deputies, to the Hôtel de Ville of Paris to confirm that the troops were withdrawing and announce that Necker had been recalled. He also confirmed the nomination of Bailly as mayor of Paris (a new title) and Lafayette as commander of the new citizens’ militia, now being called the National Guard. It was said that 150,000 armed citizens were on the streets that day, all wearing cockades in red and blue, the colours both of the city and the Duke d’Orlaéns. Later in the month Lafayette would splice them with Bourbon white for the uniform of his National Guardsmen, and so the patriotic tricolour was born. The king accepted a cockade and stuck it in his hat on arrival at the Hôtel de Ville; and then, for the first time, people began to cheer him.   [WD]Together with comte d’Artois, the family of duchesse de Polignac left France, who never reunites with Marie-Antoinette thereafter. Louis’s visit to Paris on 17 July begins with a ceremonial key conferment at the Barrière de Chaillot (rather than the Hôtel de Ville):  « J’apporte à votre Majesté les clés de sa bonne ville de Paris : ce sont les mêmes qui ont été présentées à Henri IV ; il avait reconquis son peuple, ici le peuple a reconquis son roi. »  [“I bring your Majesty the keys to his good city of Paris: these are the same ones that were presented to Henri IV; he had won back his people; here the people have won back their king.”]  —Bailly, Mémoires d'un témoin de la Révolution, Tome 2e (1804)20 July – 6 August 1789: Grande Peur  Fear of aristocratic revenge replaced such hope as news of the Bastille arrived . . . Hope, fear, and hunger made the countryside a tinder-box ignited by imagined sightings of ‘brigands’. Panics spread from five separate sparks as bushfires of angry rumours, spreading from village to village at several kilometres an hour, engulfed every region but Brittany and the east. When noble revenge failed to materialize, village militias instead turned their weapons on the seigneurial system itself, compelling seigneurs or their agents to hand over feudal registers to be burned on the village square. This extraordinary revolt came to be known as the ‘Great Fear’.  [PM]4 August 1789: Abolition of feudalism  On the night of 4 August, in an extraordinary atmosphere of panic, self-sacrifice and exhilaration, a series of nobles mounted the rostrum of the Assembly to respond to the Great Fear by renouncing their privileges and abolishing feudal dues.  [PM]This reenactment of the Nuit du 4 août 1789 freatures five orators: Isaac René Guy le Chapelier (Bernard Spiegel),Louis Marc Antoine, vicomte de Noailles (Georges Fricker),Alexandre François Marie, vicomte de Beauharnais (Frédéric Rostand),duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, andAnne-Louis-Henri de La Fare, évêque de Nancy (Jacques Plée).  M. le Président (Chapelier) a proposé ensuite de reprendre la discussion sur la déclaration de droits, dont il a été présenté plusieurs plans pour être mis en tête de la Constitution.  Séance du soir.  M. le vicomte de Noailles.  . . . je propose : 1° . . . que l’impôt sera payé par tous les individus du royaume, dans la proportion de leurs revenus ; 2° Que toutes les charges publiques seront à l’avenir supportées égaleineut par tous ; 3° Que tous les droits féodaux seront racheta. . . .  M. le vicomte de Beauharnais propose l’égalité des peines sur toutes les classes des citoyens, et leur admissibilité dans tous les emplois ecclésiastiques, civils et militaires.  M. de Lafare, évêque de Nancy,  . . . Je viens exprimer, au nom du clergé, le vœu de la justice, de la religion et de l’humanité ; je demande le rachat pour les fonds ecclésiastiques, et je demande que le rachat ne tourne pas au profit du seigneur ecclésiastique, mais qu’il en soit fait des placements utiles pour l’indigence.  [AP, Tuesday 4 August 1789]The resolutions were proclaimed as the Décrets des 4, 6, 7, 8 et 11 août 1789, or the August Decrees. Slavery was not abolished throughout France until 1794. 26 August 1789: Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the CitizenThe last article of the Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen de 1789 was voted and adopted by the Assemblée nationale constituante (National Constituent Assembly) on 26 August. In the film, excerpts of its original text are read to the Assembly by La Fayette, who prepared its first draft on 11 July.  Les Représentants du Peuple Français, constitués en Assemblée Nationale, considérant que l’ignorance, l’oubli ou le mépris des droits de l’Homme sont les seules causes des malheurs publics et de la corruption des Gouvernements, ont résolu d’exposer, dans une Déclaration solennelle, les droits naturels, inaliénables et sacrés de l’Homme, . . .  Article 1er.  Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres et égaux en droits. Les distinctions sociales ne peuvent être fondées que sur l’utilité commune.  Article 2.  . . . Ces droits sont la liberté, la propriété, la sûreté, et la résistance à l’oppression.  Article 3.  Le principe de toute Souveraineté réside essentiellement dans la Nation. . . .  . . .  Article 5.  La Loi n’a le droit de défendre que les actions nuisibles à la Société. Tout ce qui n’est pas défendu par la Loi ne peut être empêché, . . .  Article 6.  La Loi est l’expression de la volonté générale. . . . Tous les Citoyens étant égaux à ses yeux sont également admissibles à toutes dignités, places et emplois publics, . . .  Article 7.  Nul homme ne peut être accusé, arrêté ni détenu que dans les cas déterminés par la Loi, . . .  . . .  Article 9.  Tout homme étant présumé innocent jusqu’à ce qu’il ait été déclaré coupable, . . .  Article 10.  Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, . . .  Article 11.  La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des droits les plus précieux de l’Homme : tout Citoyen peut donc parler, écrire, imprimer librement, sauf à répondre de l’abus de cette liberté dans les cas déterminés par la Loi.  Article 12.  La garantie des droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen nécessite une force publique : cette force est donc instituée pour l’avantage de tous, . . .  . . .  Article 17.  La propriété étant un droit inviolable et sacré, nul ne peut en être privé, si ce n’est lorsque la nécessité publique, légalement constatée, l’exige évidemment, . . .The standard English translation is the following:  The representatives of the French people, organized as a National Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man, . . .  Article 1.  Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.  Article 2.  . . . These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.  Article 3.  The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. . . .  . . .  Article 5.  Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, . . .  Article 6.  Law is the expression of the general will. . . . All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, . . .  Article 7.  No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. . . .  . . .  Article 9.  All persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, . . .  Article 10.  No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, . . .  Article 11.  The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.  Article 12.  The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all . . .  . . .  Article 17.  Property is an inviolable and sacred right. No one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, . . .Article 11 on freedom of the press was adopted on 24 August. Two impactful revolutionary newspapers were launched in the following fall: Jean-Paul Marat’s L’Ami du peuple, or Le Publiciste parisien and Camille Desmoulins’s Révolutions de France et de Brabant. September 1789: Veto debate  Admirers of the checks and balances of the British constitution dominated the Assembly’s constitutional committee, and they believed that the king should have the same powers of veto as the British monarch. Led by Mounier, Malouet, and a handful of rich and eloquent metropolitan nobles like Lally-Tollendal and Clermont-Tonnerre, and energetically supported by Mirabeau, these monarchiens (as their opponents dubbed them) spent the first two weeks of September trying to hustle the Assembly into accepting their programme. . . . But only a handful of deputies, such as Sieyès and the prolix but still uninfluential Robespierre, believed that once the National Assembly had pronounced the monarch should have no veto at all. Most, including patriotic leaders like Barnave, Duport, and the noble Lameth brothers, were attracted to the idea of a temporary or ‘suspensive’ veto; and when Necker let it be known that this was also the king’s preference, they detected a hint that the August decrees would be sanctioned if it was carried. Consequently the suspensive veto passed overwhelmingly (673 votes to 352) on 15 September.  [WD]This tortuous deliberation started as early as in June on the Estates-General:  M. le comte de Mirabeau.  . . . Et moi, Messieurs, je crois le veto du Roi tellement nécessaire que l’aimerais mieux vivre à Constantinople qu’en France, s’il ne l’avait pas . . . je ne connaîtrais rien de plus terrible que l’aristocratie souveraine de six cents personnes qui demain pourraient se rendre inamovibles, après-demain héréditaires, et finiraient, comme les aristocrates de tous les pays du monde, par toute envahir.  [Gentlemen, I think the King’s veto so essential that I had rather live in Constantinople than in France if he did not have it. . . . I know nothing more terrible than the sovereignty of six hundred persons, who tomorrow will constitute themselves a permanent body, the next day hereditary, and will end by usurping everything.]  [AP, Tuesday 16 June 1789]In the film, Mirabeau’s view is reflected through the witty dinner chat with Camille Desmoulins, whose friendship began in the summer of 1789:  It was during these summer months, immediately after the fall of the Bastille, that the friendship began between Camille Desmoulins and Gabriel-Honoré de Riquetti, Comte de Mirabeau. . . .  It would appear that Camille first brought himself to the notice of the great Revolutionary Tribune as early as the spring of 1789, by asking for a post on the staff of the paper which Mirabeau edited.  Although there is no evidence that Camille ever contributed personally to Mirabeau’s paper, it is probable that the great man foresaw that the journalist might be useful to him in the future. . . .  He made much of Camille, he invited him to his house, gave him such dinners as the young fellow had never probably conceived as possible, showed him life in more senses of the word than one.  Camille was absolutely dazzled, and small wonder. Mirabeau was rapidly becoming the most prominent man of his day, and he was as great in fascination as in all else. Where he cared sufficiently to exert his power—and there is little doubt that he cared for Camille—he could be irresistible.  —Violet Methley, Camille Desmoulins: A Biography (1914)The papers Desmoulins drafts and Mirabeau signs are probably for Mirabeau’s Courrier de Provence. 1 October 1789: Orgie des Gardes du corps  It was the first time the Assembly had flouted popular sentiment, for in Paris and many of the provinces it was clear that any form of veto aroused deep mistrust. . . . Such paranoid attitudes were compounded by persistent economic difficulties in the capital. After falling somewhat in late July and August, the price of bread began to climb again and supplies became irregular. . . . Guards were placed on bakers’ shops, and Lafayette and his militia found themselves hard pressed to contain all the incidents that occurred.  Parallels with the situation early in July escaped no one. . . . Alarmed at persistent rumours of being taken by force to Paris, on 14 September the king summoned the notoriously well-disciplined Flanders Regiment from the north-east frontier to Versailles. . . . . Encouraged by the security it seemed to promise, the king broke silence on the August decrees. On 18 September, in a long letter drafted by Necker, he explained that he was prepared to accept some parts of the 11 August decree but not others. . . . Then on 4 October he voiced reservations about the Declaration of Rights. By now, however, Paris was alive with rumours about a reception given by the King’s bodyguard on 1 October to welcome the Flanders Regiment. After many noisy toasts had been drunk, and none to the nation, the national cockade was said to have been trampled as the air rang with unpatriotic slogans.   [WD]The banquet in honor of the Régiment de Flandre (in white uniforms) is hosted in the Opéra royal du château de Versailles by the Garde du corps du roi (in blue and red), whose major marquis d’Aguesseau (Jean-Gabriel Nordmann) proposes a toast. The orchestra are playing “Ô Richard, ô mon roi !,” an aria from André Grétry’s opéra comique Richard Cœur-de-Lion.  During the banquet, toasts to the king and royal family were drunk with enthusiasm, while the nation was omitted or rejected. . . . Suddenly the king was announced; he entered attired in a hunting dress, the queen leaning on his arm, and carrying the dauphin. Shouts of affection and devotion arose on every side. . . . while cockades were distributed; the tri-coloured cockade, it is said, was trampled on . . .   [FAM] 5–6 October 1789: Women’s March on Versailles  Banquets themselves seemed unpatriotic when bread was so scarce, and by 4 October all Paris believed that counter-revolutionary orgies at Versailles were the prelude to a new attempt to starve the capital. The next morning, several districts of the city were awakened by the ringing of the tocsin from church bell-towers, recognized ever since the days of July as a call to arms. Crowds of women began to assemble at markets, from where they marched to the Hôtel de Ville. After surging through the building to impress the city authorities with their determination, late in the morning they set off for Versailles dragging cannon and brandishing whatever makeshift weapons they could lay hands on, recruiting newcomers as they went along. Perhaps 7,000 of them reached Versailles early in the evening and invaded the National Assembly, calling for bread and punishment for those who had insulted the national cockade. The unprotected deputies had no alternative but to welcome them with mollifying speeches. They were visibly relieved when a deputation went on to confront the king.   [WD]Danton’s involvement in this insurrection can be found in Hilaire Belloc’s Danton: A Study (1899):  On the morning of Sunday, a day when there was leisure to read, the walls were placarded with the manifesto of the Cordeliers. It demanded an insurrection, and was signed with Danton’s name. On Monday morning they rang the tocsin at the belfry of the convent, and the battalion of the district was drawn up and armed.Leading the Women’s March is Stanislas-Marie Maillard, the same mod captain at the Bastille. The delegation is headed by Jean-Joseph Mounier (Jacques Penot), then president of the National Constituent Assembly, and includes Louison Chabry (Marion Grimault), a flowergirl who briefly appears at the beginning of the Café de Foy scene on 12 July.  Mounier and the deputation, of which he was the head, six deputies of the Assembly and six women, who were joined by six other women, made their way with difficulty through the crowd in the Palace d’Armes, which had become a sea of pikes and muskets. The king received them with his customary graciousness.  “Sire, we want bread,” said Louison Chabry, a pretty flower-girl of seventeen from the Palais-Royal, as speaker for the women.  “I will order all the bread in Versailles to be collected and given to you,” declared the king.  Louison, overcome by emotion at the king’s goodness, fainted. When she recovered her senses, she begged to kiss the king’s hand.  “She deserves better than that,” said the king, and embraced her.  —George H. Allen, The French Revolution, Vol. 2 (1923)In the evening, Louis signs the August Decrees and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. At midnight, La Fayette and his National Guards arrive.  The forces of order, in the shape of Lafayette and 20,000 National Guardsmen, arrived in Versailles later that night after a forced march through an autumnal downpour. Lafayette had been reluctant to come at all, leaving Paris unpoliced and thereby risking accusations that he was in complicity with the demonstrators. But his men insisted, and crowds outside the Hôtel de Ville were muttering about stringing him and Bailly up if they continued to temporize. When he arrived all he could do was try to ensure that what the populace wanted was brought about without disorder, and he formally requested the king, in the name of Paris, to return to the capital with him and take up residence in the Tuileries palace. The king made no promises that night, but early the next morning a number of Parisians found their way into the palace precincts and were fired on by royal bodyguards. Thereupon an enraged mob poured into the palace, massacred two guardsmen, and almost broke into the queen’s apartments. Only prompt action by unco-ordinated units of the National Guard contained them, and Lafayette bundled the royal family onto the palace balcony to stand under his personal protection. The impact on the volatile crowd milling below was favourable, but constant shouts of ‘To Paris!’ made clear that only one thing would really satisfy them. Late in the morning of 6 October the king announced that he would go.   [WD]The mob sneak through the Chapel Gate in the early morning, kill two guards—Miomandre de Sainte-Marie and Tardivet du Repaire—at the end of the Escalier de Marbre (Queen’s Marble Staircase), attempt to invade the Grand Appartement de la Reine but are stopped in the Queen’s Guard Room. Marie-Antoinette escapes from the Chambre de la Reine and takes refuge in the Grand Appartement du Roi, accompanied by princesse de Lamballe (in green, yet no historical record for her presence), and probably Adélaïde Genet, Madame Auguié (in ivory). In the Salon de l’Œil-de-Bœuf, they unite with Louis and the rest of the royal family—Madame Royale, Louis-Charles, and Élisabeth de France or Madame Élisabeth (Anne Létourneau, in white), Louis’s youngest sister. The childern are attended by their governess Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ, marquise de Tourzel (Louise Latraverse). Later, Madame Auguié told this waking nightmare to her sister Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, Première femme de Chambre:  About half-past four in the morning they heard horrible yells and discharges of firearms; one ran to the Queen to awaken her and get her out of bed; my sister flew to the place from which the tumult seemed to proceed; she opened the door of the antechamber which leads to the great guard-room, and beheld one of the Body Guard holding his musket across the door, and attacked by a mob, who were striking at him; his face was covered with blood; he turned round and exclaimed: “Save the Queen, madame; they are come to assassinate her!” She hastily shut the door upon the unfortunate victim of duty, fastened it with the great bolt, and took the same precaution on leaving the next room. On reaching the Queen’s chamber she cried out to her, “Get up, Madame! Don’t stay to dress yourself; fly to the King’s apartment!” The terrified Queen threw herself out of bed; they put a petticoat upon her without tying it, and the two ladies conducted her towards the oeil-de-boeuf. A door, which led from the Queen’s dressing-room to that apartment, had never before been fastened but on her side. What a dreadful moment! It was found to be secured on the other side. They knocked repeatedly with all their strength; a servant of one of the King’s valets de chambre came and opened it; the Queen entered the King’s chamber, but he was not there. Alarmed for the Queen’s life, he had gone down the staircases and through the corridors under the oeil-de-boeuf, by means of which he was accustomed to go to the Queen’s apartments without being under the necessity of crossing that room. He entered her Majesty’s room and found no one there but some Body Guards, who had taken refuge in it. The King, unwilling to expose their lives, told them to wait a few minutes, and afterwards sent to desire them to go to the oeil-de-boeuf. Madame de Tourzel, at that time governess of the children of France, had just taken Madame and the Dauphin to the King’s apartments. The Queen saw her children again. The reader must imagine this scene of tenderness and despair.  —Memoirs of Madame Campan on Marie Antoninette and Her Court, Vol. 2 (1909)At the request of La Fayette, the King and Queen confront the mob on the balcony facing the Cour de Marble:  His Majesty himself has appeared with Lafayette on the balcony, and again appears: Vive le Roi greets him from all throats; but also from some one throat is heard, ‘Le Roi à Paris, The King to Paris!’  Her Majesty too, on demand, shows herself, though there is peril in it : she steps out on the balcony, with her little boy and girl. ‘ No children, Point d’enfans! ‘ cry the voices. She gently pushes back her children; and stands alone, her hands serenely crossed on her breast: ‘Should I die,’ she had said, ‘I will do it.’ Such serenity of heroism has its eflPect. Lafayette, with ready wit, in his highflown chivalrous way, takes that fair queenly hand, and, reverently kneeling, kisses it: thereupon the people do shout Vive la Reine. Nevertheless, poor Weber ‘saw’ (or even thought he saw; for hardly the third part of poor Weber’s experiences, in such hysterical days, will stand scrutiny) ‘one of these brigands level his musket at her Majesty,’—with or without intention to shoot; for another of the brigands ‘angrily struck it down.’  —Thomas Carlyle, The French Revolution: A History, Vol. 1 (1923)Louis and the royal court move to the Tuileries Palace in the afternoon of 6 October.  A procession 60,000 strong accompanied Louis XVI and his queen on their nine-hour journey back to his capital that afternoon. . . . Nevertheless in the history of the Revolution the ‘October Days’ were decisive. Louis XVI never returned to Versailles. Henceforth he and his family would be confined to Paris, as a British observer put it, ‘more like prisoners than Princes’.   [WD](47 historical figures)",

        "content": "Often as climaxes in the plot, dozens of surgical scenes are featured in the 20 episodes of The Knick. Below is a list of the major operations with brief descriptions. Enclosed in the brackets are the participating surgeons, the first of whom leads the procedure. Chickering, by default, refers to Dr. Bertram “Bertie” Chickering, Jr. 01  CESAREAN SECTION  [Christiansen, Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] In her third pregnacy, Mrs. Warren presents with a case of placenta previa. A caesarean delivery is attempted, but saves neither Warren nor the fetus, which is the twelfth failure of the same procedure in succession.  (101) 02  INTESTINE RESECTION  [Thackery, Gallinger, Chickering, and Edwards] After an abdominal surgery for his pelvis fracture, Mr. Gentile is infected with septicemia from his lacerated bowel and develops a case of bronchitis, which prohibits the usage of ether for general anesthesia. Thackery demonstrates spinal anesthesia and removes the damaged section of the patient’s bowel with the help of an intestinal clamp he recently improved.  (101) 03  UNKNOWN  [Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] An accident occurs during an operation when Chickering is testing the new electric cauterizer. The patient is set afire. Nurse Monk is electrocuted.  (102) 04  AORTIC ANEURYSMORRHAPHY  [Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] Mr. Olynyk is suffering from an aortic aneurism. A resect-and-reconstruct procedure based on Hunterian ligation is attempted, but fails.  (102) 05  INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR  [Edwards] In his underground operating room, Edwards invents a three-layer hernia procedure and performs it on Mr. Cockrell. The repair is successful, but the patient dies later as he ignores the postoperative instruction of refraining from strenuous activity.  (103) 06  REATTACHMENT RHINOPLASTY  [Thackery] Thackery performs the rhinoplasty procedure for Mrs. Alford (Abigail Healey), infected with syphilis, using her biceps muscle pedicle flap.  (103) 07  INTESTINAL PERFORATION CLOSURE  [Thackery and Chickering] Cora Hemming develops a case of intestine perforation as a complication of her typhoid fever. During the operation, two sections of her bowel are successfully stitched together to a fold in her peritoneum.  (103) 08  FILI-GALVANOPUNCTURE OF ANEURYSMS  [Edwards, Gallinger, Thackery, and Chickering]The doctors save Mr. Gatchell from his aortic aneurysm following a gavanic procedure that combines wire insertion and electrothrombosis. Edwards coauthors the original paper.  (104) 09  UTERINE PERFORATION CLOSURE  [Thackery, Harriet, and Chickering]A Slovakian woman performs a surgical abortion on herself. The bleeding on her left uterine wall evetually leads to her death.  (104) 10  TRAUMA SURGERY  [Thackery and Edwards] Thackery saves a leg of Bunky Collier’s brother-in-law from being amputated by removing a bullet lodged in the tunica.  (105) 11  INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR  [Edwards] Edwards improves his inguinal hernia procedure by using silver wires as the medical suture for Mr. Mendieta.  (105) 12  CESAREAN SECTION  [Thackery and Chickering] During her labor, Mrs. Lefkowitz is diagnosed with an extreme case of placenta previa. A C-section is performed in 72 seconds, but fails again.  (105) 13  BLOODLETTING   [Gallinger and Harriet] Almost in a state of desperation, Gallinger performs venesection (or phlebotomy) on his own daughter Lillian to save her from meningitis. This despairing effort results in failure. (106) 14  CESAREAN SECTION   [Thackery and Chickering] By inventing the method of intrauterine balloon tamponade, which significantly reduces the danger of postpartum hemorrhage, Thackery and Chickering safely deliver the baby of a six-time multigravida.  (106) 15  APPENDECTOMY  [Christiansen and Thackery] Thackery demonstrates the method of finding the appendix of an appendicitis patient, and Christiansen proves its surgical removal. Dr. William Halsted attends the operation.  (107) 16  TRACHEOTOMY  [Thackery] Thackery saves Ping Wu from choking by performing an emergency tracheotomy.  (107) 17  TRAUMA SURGERY  [Thackery, Edwards, Chickering, and Gallinger]  The doctors attempt to save Officer Phineas Sears, who gets multiple stab wounds at his lung, liver, and kidney. Sears dies after the first operation due to internal hemorrhage.  (107) 18  TRAUMA SURGERIES  [Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, Chickering, Harriet, and Williams]  The staffs of the Knickerborker Hospital and the Minetta Negro Infirmary treat a large number of injurers from the street riot. (107) 19  CERVICOFACIAL ACTINOMYCOSIS SURGERY  [Thackery, Edwards, and Gallinger]  While removing the abscess from the patient’s mental foramen, Thackery cannot finish the procedure due to his cocaine withdrawl. Edwards takes over the scalpel.  (108) 20  BRAIN TUMOR SURGERY  [Thackery, Edwards, and Chickering]  Before dealing with the tumor, Thackery relieves the patient’s intracranial pressure through cranial trephination. The hole is left open after the operation.  (110) 21  SPLENECTOMY [Zinberg] Zinberg operates on a splenic anemia patient by surgically removing his spleen.  (110) 22  BLOOD TRANSFUSION [Thackery] Thackery transfuses his own blood to a young patient suffering from anemia caused by chlorosis. The girl is killed as a result of Thackery’s erroneous understanding of human blood types.  (110) 23  RHINOPLASTY  [Thackery] Thackery performs a cosmetic surgery on a female Cromartie patient using her “golden” earring as an insert.  (201) 24  CHOLECYSTECTOMY  [Chickering and Edwards] During the operation, Edwards supervises Chickering to separate and ligate the two cystic arteries within the patient’s cystohepatic triangle, or Calot’s triangle. (201) 25  TUBERCULAR OSTEOMYELITIS SURGERY  [Chickering and Mays] Chickering leads the procedure and dissects the abscess down to the bone to release the pus. Meanwhile, Mays shows incompetence of the surgical techique. (201) 26  RETINAL DETACHMENT REPAIR  [Thackery] The previous fight left Edwards’ retina almost separated from the rear wall of his left eye. An incision on the sclera is intended to release the subretinal fluid and thus have the retina in contact with the choroid. The operation, however, is terminated at its beginning due to Thackery’s drug withdral and hallucinations. (202) 27  HEPATIC CANCER SURGERY  [Gallinger and Edwards]  The doctors attempt to remove a tumor on the inferior surface of the patient’s liver. Edwards instructs Gallinger to bisect the healthy liver tissue leading to the tumor and tie off all blood vessles contained within. (203) 28  TRACHEOTOMY  [Mays] While cauterizing the incision, Mays ignites the flammable ether and is killed by the fire.  (204) 29  PYROTHERAPY OF NEUROSYPHILIS  [Thackery and Edwards] (Not a surgery)  Thackery elevates Abigail’s body temperature to 106 degrees Fahrenheit through the injection of malaria parasites. A higher therapeutic fever induced in a hypertherm cabinet effectively kills the syphilis spirochetes (Treponema pallidum). Her malaria is subsequently cured by quinine. (204) 30  TOPECTOMY  [Thackery] Experimenting on Mr. Sidney Carton, who loses the top of his cranium but retains an intact brain, Thackery elicits the motional and emotional responses of the patient by stimulating selected points of his brain with electric currents. Furthermore, using a rheoscope, Thackery identifies a brain spot excited after injecting the patient with a dose of morphine. In a subsequent operation, Thackery surgically removes the “morphine region,” but leaves Carton in a vegetative state. (205) 31  TRAUMA SURGERIES  [Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering] The staff of the Knick treat 124 injurers from the construction accident of the New York City subway system, in which six people die and 150 wounded. (205) 32  ESOPHAGEAL CANCER SURGERY  [Chickering, Edwards, and Zinberg] Several experimental methods are employed to treat the esophageal tumor of Anne Chickering, Bertie’s mother. After trying Röntgenotherapy, Bertie and Edwards attempt an ionic surgery by passing electric currents through mercury-coated zinc needles inserted into the tumor. After confirming its inefficacy, Bertie decides on the highly risky laryngectomy, which fails not unexpectedly due to the complex attachment of the tumor with the laryngeal, tracheal, and esophageal tissues. (206) 33  SEPARATION OF OMPHALOPAGUS TWINS  [Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering] Through X-ray examination, Thackery concludes that the only vital organ that Zoya and Nika—a pair of Minsk-borned twins conjoined by a band of cartilage and soft tissue in their midsection—share is their liver. After devising a procedure to bisect the liver with little hemorrhaging, the surgical team, including four doctors and six nurses, separate the twins after a three-and-a-half-hour battle. The entire operation is filmed by a motion picture camera. (207) 34  UMBILICAL HERNIA REPAIR  [Edwards and Gallinger] Mr. Garrison Carr is paralyzed on the operating table after Edwards injects his muscles attached to the aponeurotic membrane with a curare solution secretly distilled by Gallinger, who then saves Carr in the emergency by a tracheotomy.  (207) 35  SEPTOPLASTY [Thackery and Chickering] Thackery plans to place a celluloid insert into Abigail’s nasal cavities to support her reconstructed nose. Abruptly, Abigail dies of an anesthetic reaction before the operation starts.  (208) 36  INTESTINE RESECTION [Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] Traumatized by Abigail’s sudden death of general anesthesia, Thackery insists on demonstrating a self-surgery and resecting his own necrotic intestine sections to promote spinal anesthesia. While continuing the procedure despite the unancipatedly complicated necrosis, Thackery accidentally cuts his abdominal aorta and loses his life in his own operating room. (210) ",

        "content": "It’s the first week of a new year. Looking back, historians have attached tags to the distinct epochs of modern history: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Age, the Information Age, etc. While it’s premature to anticipate what’s coming next, the new millennium does reveal a few signatures, among which is the near-frictionless flow of common knowledge. “Journal” and “encyclopedia” are now more frequently denoting websites than giant volumes in libraries. Tens of languages are being taught online for free. Advanced learning is no longer confined within classrooms. Even elite universities are opening their doors to the middle class and underrepresented groups. The general public have never been so close to understanding and contributing to the frontiers of human civilization. The creativities of our species are being unleashed to an unprecedented extent.The accessibility of knowledge, together with the improvement in life quality and social equality, should, in principle, prompt a generation-wide desire for independent thinking and pioneering ventures. Yet it’s hardly being epitomized by the graduates of higher education institutions in general, including those from the most prestigious universities. Another trend is nevertheless pronounced—standardization: Among my friends pursing non-academic careers, around nine out of ten choose finance, consulting, or information technology, regardless of their backgrounds in college or graduate school. A fraction of those staying in academia—fortunately, not all of them—instead of enjoying the privileges of free inquiry and organized skepticism, seem to be more devoted to the cyclic game of grant-applying, result-producing, publishing, and advertising, to whom solid knowledge is merely a byproduct of their arduous work. Alternative options are occasionally considered as “unconventional” career paths, which may arouse curiosity, if not sympathy, among the ones in “mainstream” industries.One has no reason to be disturbed if all these choices are based on clear self-awareness. In fact, a large fraction of them are not. In 1883, when addressing at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, physicist Henry A. Rowland pondered the fate of human creativity in the midst of the Second Industrial Revolution:  Man is a gregarious animal, and depends very much, for his happiness, on the sympathy of those around him; and it is rare to find one with the courage to pursue his own ideals in spite of his surroundings. … To-day the railroad and the telegraph, the books and the newspapers, have united each individual man with the rest of the world: instead of his mind being an individual, a thing apart by itself, and unique, it has become so influenced by the outer world, and so dependent upon it, that it has lost its originality to a great extent.Rowland mourned the past ages of masters, and yet failed to foresee more great minds would emerge in the following century. However, what he pointed out as the suppression of individuality due to ubiquitous connections isn’t far from the truth. But it shouldn’t be simply attributed to the indecisive nature of human minds—through industrialization, a new “cult of progress” was formed, worshiping productivity, fortune, and competition. Followers are supposed to play according to the rules, contributing one’s time and intelligence in exchange for payment and recognition. A reward system was set up, acclaiming whoever outperforming their peers and elevated along the pyramid. Those reluctant to join are marginalized economically and socially. Nowadays, such systems are reigning over every sophisticated profession—business, technology, politics, law, as well as a substantial portion of academic research.One has to acknowledge that, in almost every aspect, the development of modern society has been greatly accelerated by the cult of progress. But I feel a bit uneasy to see it becoming autocratic—while stimulating the most vigorous minds, it imposes the pressure of abandoning originality and long-term goals for instant success, and evokes a sense of failure to those hesitating to participate. Across the intellectual spectrum, pioneering accomplishments are rarely fruits of hypercompetition, opportunism, or populism. Instead, they are more likely to be crafted by genuine passion, determination, and the ability to pinpoint truly significant problems.Decisions are left for us to make. As far as I’m concerned, the foundation of education shouldn’t be the acquisition of professional skills, nor the so-called critical thinking and problem-solving, even if they can be well defined. It is the formation of values—a set of underivable yet influenceable guidelines on what we appreciate and distain, and what motivates us, in the first place, to think and act. If there happens to be a voice inside us yearning for more than a programmed life, why not listen to it and see what it leads to. After all, its chance to survive, given the overall prosperity and openness of the new millennium, should exceed that at any time in the past. And we might be able to taste a pleasure not accessed by many—unlike winning or profiting, being how we boastfully call ourselves: sapiens. ",

        "content": "  My Fair Lady isn’t a love story or a princess myth. It is a story of transformation, though perhaps not the one we expect.  —Alexis Gargagliano, in Lincoln Center Theater ReviewIndeed. For years, I’d been left the impression of My Fair Lady being a fairy tale—charming, vibrant, witty, yet too miraculous to be real, too elegant to be affecting—until I walked into the Vivian Beaumont Theater, where I was showered with immense joy and pain.Lerner &amp; Loewe’s comedy isn’t merely about how individual lives could be reshaped by phonetics in unexpected ways, and it extends beyond a reflection on gender roles and social classes in Edwardian England. At the heart of My Fair Lady are the elations and tears of the ones wishing to rewrite their fates, and the inherent intellectual strength and emotional weakness of human beings. While laughing and clapping, we might suddenly discover the bittersweet lesson behind the amusing story, the moment we start suspecting if the front curtain is just a mirror.A considerable fraction of the fascination of My Fair Lady originates from the straight play it is based on—George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion. But the creativities of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe aren’t secondary—musicalizing Pygmalion without diluting its linguistic charm and dramatic tension would be a delicate task. Lerner and Loewe did it respectfully—the storyline, characters, and spoken dialogue of their musical are mostly inherited from the play. Consequently, the depth and sharpness of the Shavian classic are very well preserved.However great the book is, any musical would pale without its score. “‘What is too silly to be said may be sung’—well, yes; but what is too subtle to be said, or too deeply felt, or too revealing or too mysterious—these things can also be sung and only be sung.” The remark by Kenneth Clark in his Civilisation can’t be better illustrated by My Fair Lady—when the dialogue takes a breath, music cuts in, amplifying the exhilaration, believes, wishes, prejudice, disdain, or confusion of the roles, then gives the floor back to words. Verbal wits and sensual pleasures constructively interfere, performing a duet that is delightfully serious and seriously delightful.Meanwhile, music possesses a unique descriptive power. Songs form characters, often nearly define them—the whistling cockneys at Covent Garden, the grumbling servants at 27A Wimpole Street, the aristocratic gathering at Ascot, the mindlessly-in-love Freddy, and—the most vivid of all—Alfred P. Doolittle, the dancing and orating epicurean who can barely afford liquors but not morals. The hero and heroine, however, can’t be delineated even by five songs each. One has to go through every single line to decode the impetus of their fates.The invincible GalateaShe wasn’t noble, but had no fear. She sought from the crowd for witness to protect herself against the mistaken charge. She insisted on checking the “detective’s” notebook to ensure she’s free of accusation. She promised to call the police if being mistreated in the “boarding school.” She greeted a scorning gentleman with the spirit of a true citizen: “I’ve a right to be here if I like, same as you.”She was poor, but never fell. She never drinks despite her bibulous family. She won’t be tempted by gold and diamonds. She struggled for her lodging, whereas still dreamed of warmth and love. As she constantly reminds herself and the world: “I’m a good girl, I am!”It would be a huge mistake to think the pre-metamorphosis Eliza merely as a boisterous flowergirl desperate for every tuppence. Although in a less graceful condition, she lived with dignity, discipline, and hope. But nothing could match her knocking on the door of 27A Wimpole Street to negotiate the details of that mocking offer of speech training—she managed to filter out the condescendence, and seize the opportunity to learn and reform. She wouldn’t be easily hurt, but never supplicated. She reasoned that English lessons shouldn’t cost more than French lessons, and yet proposed a tuition that surprised the celebrated phoneticist, considering her limited income.An experiment was launched, but yields unanticipated results: After four months, at the Ascot races, she already acquired a glorious pronunciation, yet didn’t know what to talk. Six weeks later, at the Embassy Ball, she could speak and behave like the most charming princess. The linguistic experiment per se should be called a success. Nevertheless, Eliza is transformed into not a lady but a perfect doll, who can only be manipulated and rely on the kindness of others.Earlier on that cold spring night, she sat on a dustcart, picked up cabbage leaves as fans, and sang the sweetest melody in London:  All I want is a room somewhere; Far away from the cold night air. With one enormous chair; Oh, wouldn’t be loverly? . . . Someone’s head restin’ on my knee; Warm and tender as he can be, Who takes good care of me; Oh, wouldn’t it be loverly?Six months later, she sits in a luxurious armchair next to a fireplace, without feeling a bit of warmth. She converses with duchesses, dances with princes, yet not receiving any care. She hurls the slippers at her Professor and escapes from her private school. At Covent Garden, besides the old columns and folks, she hums her Loverly tune, weeping. She now belongs to nowhere—too genteel to be a flowergirl, yet too weak to be a lady. She gets everything in her dream, but nothing is lovely.It’s not the end of the transformation. It’s only the beginning, the first step in a new world.She leaves her egocentric and manipulative tutor. She dries her tears and moves on—this time, with an elegant speech and an indomitable heart, which has endured the pains as she learns to tell “Spain” from “Spine,” domination from care, limerence from love, and etiquette from respect. She doesn’t mind evolving into a more cultured Ms. Doolittle, and meanwhile will remain that loverly Eliza.That’s the making of the fairest lady.The vulnerable PygmalionHe lives in his profession. He invents his own universal alphabets and arranges his home like a phonetic laboratory. He can pronounce 130 different vowels and place a person by their accent within six miles in England or two miles in London. To him, an articulate speech is a divine gift from the God:  Think what you’re dealing with. The majesty and grandeur of the English language. It’s the greatest possession we have. The noblest sentiments that ever flowed in the hearts of men are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative and musical mixtures of sounds.He sincerely believes so.The world of Henry Higgins is simple and orderly—he uses the laws of linguistics or science in general as the measure of everything. In his mind, humans are classified according to their speeches, and the attractiveness of a person is determined by either their intellectual capacity or the uniqueness of their dialect. He despises anyone who “incarnates insult to English language” regardless of their gender, look, status, or occupation. He has equally low esteem for the uneducated populace and the pretentious, empty-headed nobles. He detests all characters against rationality, independence, and serenity. He is extremely principled, and assumes his principles ought to be obeyed by the whole civilized world. Of course, they aren’t.His contentious beliefs are challenged by Eliza. He can’t understand why the grand success of his experiment leads to her emotional breakdown. Moreover, he observes a strange feeling that has never existed before:  I was serenely independent and content before we met; Surely I could always be that way again—and yet I’ve grown accustomed to her looks; Accustomed to her voice; Accustomed to her face. At Mrs. Higgins’ place, he is defeated by the new Lady Eliza. He encounters his own coldness and arrogance. He is told how hurtful his words and deeds can be, and that he plays nothing but a replaceable role to any living creature. Yet he has no choice but to confess—acknowledging the truth complies with his values more than pretending to be deaf.The 2018 Lincoln Center Theater production ends in an air of melancholy—Eliza enters with her voice played on a gramophone, delivers her famous last line, and exits downstage, slowly disappearing from Higgins’ sight. Note that aisles haven’t been used as exits in interior scenes throughout the show, which, in my opinion, implies Eliza’s last presence is imaginary. In reality, as she promised, she never sees him again. He bids farewell to her—a rare counterpart of him, who truly appreciates his enthusiasm, shares his perseverance, and perceives his frailty. He will start a new chapter of his life, this time, learning to be a human.Being transformed, who are we?Higgins’ lady training program isn’t purely fictitious—in reality, we call it education, the systematic procedure through which young people may change their fates. Many are undergoing a metamorphosis no easier than that of Eliza, especially those pursuing higher education at a prestigious university in a foreign country.I’m now a few years older than Eliza, yet still struggling to accurately pronounce the fifteen distinct vowels in American English: the near-close near-front unrounded /ɪ/, the near-close near-back rounded /ʊ/, etc. I’m rebuilding my vocabulary, using the handbooks intended for teenagers or those without a decent education. I’m assimilating a different set of attitudes and methods in scientific research. I’m resetting my knowledge, especially that on social sciences and humanities. I’m acquiring the basic skills of writing and communication. I’m overhauling my manners and values. There are nights I couldn’t put my books down, either too concentrated or too occupied. There are also “The Rain in Spain” moments, when “at once my heart took flight.” I’m surrounded by enlightening mentorships, as well as aimless zeal. I’ve be constantly encouraged, yet occasionally mocked.We’re exploring a world we’ve never been to. We’re being transformed into someone we aren’t familiar with. We’re approaching thousands of new excitements, yet distanced from many simple joys. We’re gaining knowledge and achievements, but they don’t naturally bring care or love.We can spend a night dancing or weeping. But when the morning is smearing up the sky, we’d go back to our phonetic charts, or any endeavor we choose to undertake.Most importantly, however “ladylike” we’ll become in the coming years, never let the spirit of that vigorous, fearless flowergirl be taken away from us—that’s what launched the transformation, and what essentially powers it. Some day in the future, when hesitating or lost, we shall recall the courage inside us the moment we knocked on the door of our 27A Wimpole Street and said:“I washed my face and hands before I come. If you were a gentleman, you would ask me to sit down.”",

        "content": "We are living in an era when scientific research, like trade and manufacture, has grown into a sophisticated social activity—flourishing, dynamic, and highly organized. The thrill of glancing through publications on high-profile academic journals can only be matched by that of watching fluyts sailing into and out of the 17th-century Amsterdam or Model Ts coming off the 1920s Ford assembly line. But the prosperity of science doesn’t provide straightforward answers to two classes of questions: those on the origin of science and those on its destination—namely, why we do science and what science is used for. We’ve been forced to reconsider the relation between science and human society by a series of disconcerting events, which are, in recent years, becoming more perplexing.A few days ago, it was announced that two gene-edited babies have been born in China. Interestingly, the academia and the market reacted oppositely to this controversial leap: Scientists around the world are overwhelmingly denouncing this clinical application as irresponsible, unethical, and medically unnecessary. But investors seemed to find the smell of success—top stocks on gene-editing technology unanimously traded higher. Accessible information indicates this in-human trial is most likely to be funded by private capital and aimed at commercial interests. And the so-called “unexpected leakage” of results is in fact carefully orchestrated. Notably, this one-year-and-nine-month experiment would be impossible without an interdisciplinary team including experts in gene editing, sequencing, in vitro fertilization, animal testing, financing, and publicity, as well as the participation of an HIV care organization and the permission from medical regulation agencies. All these professionals collaborated quietly and introduced the twins to our world, without realizing the mark they would add to the timeline of human evolution.But to me, the Theranos case—first revealed in 2015 and still under investigation—is even more terrifying: a nine-billion-dollar biotech unicorn could be built entirely on deception, and yet had won enormous acclaims—a charismatic young founder, a “revolutionary” blood-testing technology, over 700-million-dollar investment, a board of directors including seven eminent statesmen, and in every aspect, a new Silicon Valley miracle. Science, medicine, business, law, and media—most brilliant inventions of human beings—were maneuvered by their best practitioners to mislead doctors, endanger patients, and defraud investors in the name of ideas, innovations, and “changing the world.” The meticulously designed fraud could be continuing had it not been for an investigative reporter with The Wall Street Journal and a brave young man—the grandson of a Theranos trustee and former US Secretary of State.Technological hypes have never appeared so frequently while being keenly applauded. What should be condemned aren’t the moral wrongs of a few individuals. It’s a culture, which most STEM students are currently immersed in, that needs to be reexamined—the one that prioritizes what sounds cool and what pays more, instead of finding out what benefits the society in the long term. We are surrounded by the view that the ultimate goal of scientific research is commercialization. We are being indoctrinated in a narrow definition of success that puts impact, fame, and reward ahead of anything else. We might occasionally find our education distanced from the basic mission of science—to answer, to our best knowledge, what is true, what is not true, and what we don’t know.Personally, I can foresee a tragedy if science is one day dominated by the rules of the business world and loses the values of its own. An often overlooked point is: at the most fundamental level, science reshapes the world not because it makes people more productive, creative, or competitive—though it does—but because while establishing it people learn to be respectful to truths. Outside their laboratories, scientists have to watch closely how the knowledge they created is applied to the real world. They shoulder the obligations to prevent science from being misinterpreted or misused, and to ensure that our greatest intellectual endeavor is serving the common good, or—as a tribute to an old address—of, by, and for the humanity. I say the most irreplaceable role of scientists in the modern society is that of a navigator—leading the crew to catch the ocean currents and avoid the icebergs, and sharing their unbiased information on the best routes for the ship to move on.",

        "content": "For a while I’ve been finding myself younger than I look, sometimes almost a schoolboy:I’m curious about how a sewing machine stitches, how a horn pitches, and how a Space Shuttle lands.I’m learning to better convey myself in the language I speak every day.I feel more at ease reading a history book with a dictionary, and yet, one week later, I often can’t remember the names of those heroes and cities.Until a few months ago, I couldn’t tell a hyphen, an en dash, and an em dash apart.I’m puzzled by a new foreign language—why there have to be more tenses than what seems necessary.. . .It is as if I were back to my childhood.Moving to a new country for graduate school means a lot more than pursing a degree or getting professional training. The elements of my days are different from what I was used to. I’m holding thoughts and attitudes I could never imagine. I’ve been encountering opinions that are the exact opposite of mine, yet closer to the truth. There are moments of exhilaration, as well as of unease and doubt—like what a child would experience in an exotic garden without their parents around.I’m being taught to explore science as the way nature works, instead of merely as equations and models on paper.It has been implanted in my mind that in research, integrity, clarity, and originality outweigh productivity and popularity, as they should always do.I’ve realized that there are more dimensions in one’s education. Science &amp; Engineering is merely one of them. Test preparation isn’t really one of them.I now believe that confidence and vigor are the cornerstones of all achievements, which can only be exhausted by fear and cynicism.I’m being shown that active communication is the expressway to pleasure, for ourselves and for others.. . .The essence of childhood is neither innocence nor immaturity. It’s a unique period when a new world is unwrapped in front of us, in which we try, fail, learn, and reform ourselves. It’s less common that an adult has to go through it again. But I am willing to. To me, it’s more fun to watch how much one can change than how much one can achieve.I kept a diary when I was a kid. Now it’s a good time to resume this habit.",
